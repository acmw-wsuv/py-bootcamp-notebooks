Bulbasaur,1,Bulbasaur is a Grass/Poison type Pokémon introduced in Generation 1. It is known as the Seed Pokémon.,"Bulbasaur is a small, quadruped Pokémon that has blue-green skin with darker patches. It has red eyes with white pupils, pointed, ear-like structures on top of its head, and a short, blunt snout with a wide mouth. A pair of small, pointed teeth are visible in the upper jaw when its mouth is open. Each of its thick legs ends with three sharp claws. On its back is a green plant bulb, which is grown from a seed planted there at birth. The bulb provides it with energy through photosynthesis as well as from the nutrient-rich seeds contained within.

As mentioned in the anime, starter Pokémon are raised by Breeders to be distributed to new Trainers. Having been domesticated from birth, Bulbasaur is regarded as both a rare and well-behaved Pokémon. It is known to be extremely loyal, even after long-term abandonment. Bulbasaur has also shown itself to be an excellent caretaker, even having a special technique called the ""Bulba-by."" To perform this technique, Bulbasaur uses its vines to pick up a young Pokémon and soothingly rocks it in the air.

It is found in grasslands and forests throughout the Kanto region. However, due to Bulbasaur's status as starter Pokémon, it is hard to come by in the wild and generally found under the ownership of a Trainer. It has been observed that a Bulbasaur's bulb will flash blue when it is ready to evolve. If it does not want to evolve, it struggles to resist the transformation. Many Bulbasaur gather every year in a hidden garden in Kanto to evolve into Ivysaur in a ceremony led by a Venusaur.

Ivysaur,2,Ivysaur is a Grass/Poison type Pokémon introduced in Generation 1. It is known as the Seed Pokémon.,"Ivysaur is a quadruped Pokémon that has blue-green skin with darker patches. On top of its head are pointed ears with black insides and it has narrow red eyes. It has a short, rounded snout with a wide mouth and two pointed teeth in its upper jaw. Each of its feet has three claws on them. The bulb on its back has bloomed into a large pink bud. A short brown trunk surrounded by leafy green fronds supports the bud. The weight of the plant prevents Ivysaur from standing on its hind legs and forces its legs to grow sturdy. When its flower is ready to bloom, it gives off a distinct, strong sweet-smelling aroma and starts swelling. Ivysaur will also start spending more time in sunlight in preparation for its upcoming evolution. Exposure to sunlight adds to the strength of both Ivysaur and its plant. Ivysaur's natural habitat is plains.

Venusaur,3,Venusaur is a Grass/Poison type Pokémon introduced in Generation 1. It is known as the Seed Pokémon.,"Venusaur is a squat, quadruped Pokémon with bumpy, blue-green skin. It has small, circular red eyes, a short, blunt snout, and a wide mouth with two pointed teeth in the upper jaw and four in the lower jaw. On top of its head are small, pointed ears with reddish pink insides. It has three clawed toes on each foot. The bud on its back has bloomed in a large pink, white-spotted flower. The flower is supported by a thick, brown trunk surrounded by green fronds. A female Venusaur will have a seed in the center of its flower.

As Mega Venusaur, the flower on its back grows larger and two smaller pink flowers bloom, one on its forehead and one on its rear. The weight of the flower causes its legs and back to become sturdier in order to support it. Additional leaves with woody stems, which are supported by vines, are grown around the flower. Mega Venusaur also develops dark markings on its forehead below the new flower.

Venusaur uses its flower to catch the sun's rays to convert them into energy, which causes the flower to become more vibrant. The flower releases a soothing scent that attracts Pokémon and calms emotions. This scent becomes stronger after a rainy day. In the anime, Venusaur has demonstrated the ability to manipulate nature, release several vines from its back, and lead evolution ceremonies for Bulbasaur and Ivysaur. Frenzy Plant was its signature move in the past. This Pokémon is rarely found in the wild, but has been known to inhabit grasslands.

Charmander,4,Charmander is a Fire type Pokémon introduced in Generation 1. It is known as the Lizard Pokémon.,"Charmander is a bipedal, reptilian Pokémon with a primarily orange body and blue eyes. Its underside from the chest down and the soles of its feet are cream-colored. It has two small fangs visible in its upper jaw and two smaller fangs in its lower jaw. A fire burns at the tip of this Pokémon's slender tail and has blazed there since Charmander's birth. The flame can be used as an indication of Charmander's health and mood, burning brightly when the Pokémon is strong, weakly when it is exhausted, wavering when it is happy, and blazing when it is enraged. It is said that Charmander dies if its flame goes out. However, if the Pokémon is healthy, the flame will continue to burn even if it gets a bit wet and is said to steam in the rain.

Charmander can be found in hot, mountainous areas. However, it is found far more often in the ownership of Trainers. As shown in Pokémon Snap, Charmander exhibits pack behavior, calling others of its species if it finds food.

Charizard,6,Charizard is a Fire/Flying type Pokémon introduced in Generation 1. It is known as the Flame Pokémon.,"Charizard is a draconic, bipedal Pokémon. It is primarily orange with a cream underside from the chest to the tip of its tail. It has a long neck, small blue eyes, slightly raised nostrils, and two horn-like structures protruding from the back of its rectangular head. There are two fangs visible in the upper jaw when its mouth is closed. Two large wings with blue-green undersides sprout from its back, and a horn-like appendage juts out from the third joint of each wing. A single wing-finger is visible through the center of each wing membrane. Charizard's arms are short and skinny compared to its robust belly, and each limb has three white claws. It has stocky legs with cream-colored soles on each of its plantigrade feet. The tip of its long, tapering tail burns with a sizable flame.

Charizard has two Mega Forms. Both feature a shorter snout, white, vertical slit pupils, and a bright underside reaching the lower jaw.

As Mega Charizard X, its body and legs are more physically fit, though its arms remain thin. Its skin turns black with a sky-blue underside and soles. Two spikes with blue tips curve upward from the front and back of each shoulder, while the tips of its horns sharpen, turn blue, and curve slightly upward. Its brow and claws are larger, and its eyes are now red. It has two small, fin-like spikes under each horn and two more down its lower neck. The finger disappears from the wing membrane, and the lower edges are divided into large, rounded points. The third joint of each wing-arm is adorned with a claw-like spike. Mega Charizard X breathes blue flames out the sides of its mouth, and the flame on its tail now burns blue. It is said that its new power turns it black and creates more intense flames.

As Mega Charizard Y, it becomes sleeker in appearance but retains its normal coloration. It has three pointed horns on the back of its head, the middle of which is longer. Its snout has larger fangs and a ridge on the nose. Its neck is shorter, but its torso is thinner and longer. It features longer digitigrade feet. Its hands are less developed, with extremely shortened fingers that are no longer separated each from the others. Small wings develop on its wrists, while the ones on its back become larger, lose the wing finger passing through their membrane and end up with ragged edges. The back of its tail has a large spike at the base and three smaller ones near the tip, which now burns with a longer flame. Mega Charizard Y is said to have incredible flying prowess that is greater than a jet fighter.

Charizard flies in search of powerful opponents to battle, and its fire will burn hotter as it gains experience. Its fiery breath is capable of melting boulders, massive glaciers, and has been known to accidentally cause forest fires. In the past, Blast Burn was its signature move. Charizard typically inhabit mountains and valleys, such as the Charicific Valley in Johto. The anime has shown that only a weak Charizard would show off its power. It also showed that Charizard is able to swim underwater, with Pokémon Origins further showing that the flame on the tip of the tail can still keep burning underwater.

Squirtle,7,Squirtle is a Water type Pokémon introduced in Generation 1. It is known as the Tiny Turtle Pokémon.,"Squirtle is a small Pokémon that resembles a light blue turtle. While it typically walks on its two short legs, it has been shown to run on all fours in Super Smash Bros. Brawl. It has large, purplish or reddish eyes and a slightly hooked upper lip. Each of its hands and feet have three pointed digits. The end of its long tail curls inward. Its body is encased by a tough shell that forms and hardens after birth. This shell is brown on the top, pale yellow on the bottom, and has a thick white ridge between the two halves.

Squirtle's shell is a useful tool. It can withdraw into the shell for protection or to sleep. The grooved, rounded shape helps to reduce water resistance when this Pokémon swims. Squirtle can spray foamy water from its mouth with great accuracy. Squirtle is scarce in the wild, although it can be found around small ponds and lakes.

Wartortle,8,Wartortle is a Water type Pokémon introduced in Generation 1. It is known as the Turtle Pokémon.,"Wartortle is a bipedal, indigo Pokémon similar to a turtle. It has brown eyes, a dark blue streak on each cheek, and two sharp teeth protruding from its upper jaw. It has three clawed fingers and pointed toes. On each side of its head are feather-like ears covered in pale blue fur. A brown shell with a pale yellow underside encases its body. A thick, white rim separates the upper and lower halves of the shell. An older Wartortle may have scars and algae growing on its shell. Poking out of the bottom of the shell is a thick, wavy tail that also has light blue fur and cannot be fully withdrawn into its shell. Its tail fur will darken with age. Its tail is a popular symbol of longevity and good luck, making this Pokémon popular with the elderly.

To maintain balance while swimming at high speeds, Wartortle moves its furry ears and tail. Air can be stored in its fur for extended underwater diving. It hides in water when hunting and emerges to surprise its prey. The anime has shown that Wartortle can be found living in colonies on islands, but its preferred habitat seems to be freshwater ponds and lakes. In the past, Skull Bash was its signature move.

Blastoise,9,Blastoise is a Water type Pokémon introduced in Generation 1. It is known as the Shellfish Pokémon.,"Blastoise is a large, bipedal turtle-like Pokémon. Its body is blue and is mostly hidden by its tough, brown shell. This shell has a cream-colored underside and a white ridge encircling its arms and separating the upper and lower halves. Two powerful water cannons reside in the top of shell over its shoulders. These cannons can be extended or withdrawn. Blastoise's head has triangular ears that are black on the inside, small brown eyes, and a cream-colored lower jaw. Its arms are thick, and it has three claws on each hand. Its feet have three claws on the front and one on the back. Poking out of the bottom of its shell is a stubby tail.

The powerful cannons on this Pokémon's back are capable of producing water blasts that can pierce steel and concrete and can be used for high-speed charges. Blastoise deliberately makes itself heavy to withstand these powerful blasts and to crush its opponents. It has two former signature moves, Skull Bash and Hydro Cannon. The anime has shown that Blastoise can take the role of a leader in large groups of Squirtle and Wartortle. Its preferred habitat seems to be freshwater ponds and lakes.

As Mega Blastoise, it develops two smaller shells over its arms, each with their own water cannon. The two cannons on its back are replaced by a single, central water cannon of greater size that can retract into its shell. This cannon extends forward over Mega Blastoise's head and is said to have a blast range of over 6 miles (10 kilometers).[1] Small ridges develop over its now-red eyes and extend to its ears. The ears angle slightly backward and there is a small point on its chin.

Caterpie,10,Caterpie is a Bug type Pokémon introduced in Generation 1. It is known as the Worm Pokémon.,"Caterpie is a Pokémon that resembles a green caterpillar with a yellow underside and teardrop-shaped tail. There are yellow ring-shaped markings down the sides of its segmented body, which resemble its eyes and are meant to scare off predators. Its most notable characteristic is the bright red antenna (osmeterium) on its head, which releases a stench to repel predators. Despite these features and its camouflage in green foliage, Caterpie is often preyed upon by Flying-type Pokémon. Its four tiny feet are tipped with suction cups, permitting this Pokémon to scale most surfaces with minimal effort.

Caterpie is easy to capture and grows quickly, making it ideal for new Trainers. It will shed its skin many times before finally cocooning itself in thick silk. It can also spit this silk in order to entangle foes as seen in the anime. It has a voracious appetite, which drives it to eat a hundred leaves a day. It will even eat leaves bigger than itself. According to Pokémon Adventures, its favorite food is the Vermilion flower. Caterpie lives in temperate forests and jungles.

Its body is crescent-shaped with several segments making up the lower point. The front of its shell resembles a face with heavy-lidded eyes and a sharply pointed nose. The back of its shell consists of several geometrically shaped portions and projections. Its soft body is protected by a hard outer shell while it undergoes metamorphosis. While this shell is said to be as hard as steel, a sudden, powerful impact could cause its liquid innards to pop out, leaving it completely exposed. Metapod generally remains motionless, rebuilding its cells for evolution. If an enemy discovers Metapod, it is unable to do anything other than harden its outer shell. Metapod lives in temperate forests and jungles.

Butterfree has two black antennae, a light blue snout with two fangs underneath, and large, red compound eyes. Its two pairs of wings are white with black venation. Two oval scales on a female Butterfree's lower wings are black, but they are white on a male.

Butterfree's wings are covered with poisonous powders that fall off continuously as it flies. It will defend Caterpie from bird Pokémon using this powder. This powder also repels water, enabling it to gather honey even in the rain. Butterfree will roam up to six miles (ten kilometers) from its nest in search of honey, which it carries with the hairs of its legs. Sometimes it has territorial disputes with Cutiefly over fields of flowers. It also consumes sap from trees pierced by Heracross, as seen in the anime. Butterfree is found in temperate forests and jungles, but it has also been observed flying near the ocean as part of its migratory breeding pattern.

A similar black structure connects its head and thorax. The stinger on its abdomen is now a pale yellow, and it now has black stripes over its entire body. Fast-acting poison is stored in the stingers on its limbs, while the tail stinger produces a slow-acting poison that is used to finish opponents. The instantaneous poisons are instead used to prevent the foe from fleeing.[1]

Beedrill is highly territorial and normally lives in colonies. As seen in the anime, Beedrill seems to be especially concerned with the welfare of Weedle and Kakuna and it will respond aggressively to those that disturb them. Disturbing a swarm of Beedrill will cause the whole colony to attack. It flies at high speed and attacks using the large venomous stingers on its forelegs and abdomen.

Pidgeot grows noticeably when it Mega Evolves developing a larger body and longer, broader wings. Its wingtips and tail feathers are tipped with blue, and its cream coloring is now white. Its eyes turn red and its pupils turn white. Mega Pidgeot has an even more elaborate crest on its head, with a streamer-like red plume extending from a mane of yellow feathers. A red feather projects from the front of its crest and a there is a single red highlight on the left side. The crest is sensitive to air currents, acting like a large antenna and stabilizing Mega Pidgeot's flight.[1] Additionally, its increased wing power allows it to fly for two weeks without rest.

Pidgeot's powerful wings are capable of stirring up windstorms in just a few flaps, and it may spread its wings to intimidate enemies. This Pokémon is capable of flying faster than the speed of sound. Its plumage is often described as beautiful, making it a popular choice for skilled Trainers. Gust and Feather Dance are its former signature moves. Pidgeot typically dwells in temperate forests with thick growth and large trees. It is known to prey on Magikarp, which it can spot from great heights.

Rattata,19,Rattata is a Normal type Pokémon introduced in Generation 1. It is known as the Mouse Pokémon.,"Rattata is a small, quadruped rodent Pokémon. It has purple fur with a cream-colored face, paws, and underbelly. It has narrow, red eyes, rounded ears with cream-colored insides, and a single whisker on each cheek. Its long tail is tightly curled at the end. Its most notable feature is its large teeth. Like most rodents, its teeth grow continuously throughout its life and must be worn down by gnawing. A female Rattata will have shorter whiskers and lighter fur.

Rattata can live wherever it can find food, which it searches for most of the day. Thanks to its sharp fangs, it is able to eat nearly anything. When it is threatened, Rattata can deliver a powerful bite. Its large teeth are also useful when using its former signature moves, Hyper Fang and Super Fang. Furret is the natural predator of the Rattatta. Its hardiness lets it live in many environments, although it mainly lives on plains and savannas. Because it reproduces so quickly, a pair of Rattata can quickly colonize an area.

Rattata are non-native to Alola and arrived in cargo ships. The Rattata population in Alola was booming until Yungoos was imported as a control measure. In order to avoid these new predators, Rattata altered its habits. It moved to more urban areas, became nocturnal, and formed large nests led by Raticate.[1] Alolan Rattata searches out fresh food by smell and ignore anything spoiled. It has even been known to sneak into people's homes to find food. It has dark gray fur and grayish-purple ear insides. There are two tufts of fur on each ear and near the tip of its tail. Its long, thin whiskers are replaced by shorter, thicker tufts of fur as well. The line where its cream underbelly meets its gray fur is ragged instead of smooth. This variant of Rattata is the shortest Dark-type.

Raticate,20,Raticate is a Normal type Pokémon introduced in Generation 1. It is known as the Mouse Pokémon.,"Raticate is a large rodent Pokémon. Although it is often depicted on its hind legs, it is a quadruped. It is mostly tawny colored with a cream underside. It has narrow black eyes, ears with ragged edges and dark insides, and large incisors that grow constantly. There are three whiskers on each side of its face, which it uses to maintain balance. It has short arms with three-fingered hands and webbed feet with three toes. The webbing on its feet allows it to swim. Its tail is long and scaly. A female will have shorter whiskers and lighter fur.

If attacked, Raticate stands up on its hind legs, bares its fangs and shrieks in an intimidating manner at its enemy. It is willing to take on larger foes if provoked enough. Its teeth are strong enough to gnaw through steel and their constant growth means it often needs to gnaw on something, like rocks and logs. It may even chew on the walls of houses, and is capable of chewing through cinderblocks and toppling concrete buildings. Its large incisors are also used for its former signature moves, Hyper Fang and Super Fang. This Pokémon typically lives in plains and savannas.

In Alola, Raticate has become heavier and darker due to its urban environment and higher calorie diet.[1] Its fur is mostly black with a brown, leaf-shaped patch on its belly and brown inside its ears. Its hands, feet, cheeks, and tail are a whitish-cream color, and its hands are much smaller. It has large, puffy cheeks with four whiskers under its chin and two sprouting sideways from the top of each cheek. Its large incisors are still visible, but its eyes are now red. This variant uses its nest as a food stockpile, and generally prefers to have the Alolan Rattata it commands collect food while it remains in its nest and eats. It is selective in what it eats, however, only eating fresh, high quality foods. Rumor has it that a certain high-class restaurant even exploits this selectivity, bringing Raticate along to buy ingredients and letting it taste test new dishes.

Spearow,21,Spearow is a Normal/Flying type Pokémon introduced in Generation 1. It is known as the Tiny Bird Pokémon.,"Spearow is an avian Pokémon that is very small. It has rough, brown plumage on its head and three brown tail feathers. It has narrow, dark brown eyes with white pupils and a short, hooked beak that is light pink. The feathers covering its wings are pinkish red with lighter tips, and it has a beige underside with two thin, horizontal stripes. Its light pink feet have two toes in front and one in the back. Black feathers cover its back.

Although inept at other aspects of its flying, such as height and distance, Spearow is still capable of flying quickly to protect its territory. However, it must flap its wings at high speeds to stay aloft. Spearow's loud shrieks can be heard over half a mile (one kilometer) away, and are used to warn other of its kind of danger. The anime has shown that Spearow sees in black and white and will chase its foes in a large flock. Spearow are found naturally in open habitats with warmer climates, mainly desolate wastelands and fields, where it hunts for insects. Ekans is a natural predator of Spearow.

Fearow has been around mostly unchanged for many years, as a Pokémon resembling it has been seen on ancient murals. Its large wings and stamina allow it to fly for an entire day without landing. Its long neck and beak allow it to pluck prey from both land and water, and it has even been known to steal from unwary humans. It will shoot upward, and then dive down to catch prey. It will also catch tiny insects that hide underground and circle the ocean for fish. Fearow are found naturally in open habitats with warmer climates, mainly wastelands and desolate fields.

Ekans has three pairs of black lines encircling its body, as well as another line that connects to each slit-pupiled eye and curves toward its nose. Its large mouth has a round, pink tongue and no visible teeth. While painful, a newborn Ekans's bite is not venomous. This Pokémon grows longer with age.

Ekans lives in grassy savannas and plains, where it moves stealthily through grass. It can also be found in forests and desolate wastelands, where it preys on Eggs from Pidgey and Spearow nests, but will strike other prey from behind. By flicking its tongue out, it is able to detect danger and the scent of prey. Its jaw can detach to swallow large prey, but such a meal can make Ekans too heavy to move or become stuck and cause it to faint. It wraps itself around tree branches at night to rest. If not in a tree, it will coil itself up—a position in which it can defend itself from all directions. It was also shown in the second movie to possess some swimming abilities. Its former signature move is Glare.

The pattern typically has two red and yellow eyespots outlined in black, a wide black streak resembling an upturned mouth, and a black V-shaped stripe above the eyespots.

Arbok is capable of crushing opponents by coiling its body around them and squeezing them tightly. It can even flatten steel oil drums. If it encounters an enemy, it raises its head, mimics, and stuns the opponent using the frightening pattern on its body. It can also make eerie sounds by expelling air from its mouth. It has been stated that if any part of Arbok's body except for the head is cut off, it can regrow the rest of its body again in a matter of a few weeks. It also has the ability to detect vibrations as shown in the anime. Arbok has been known to be capable of spending long periods underwater and surviving in aquatic environments. One particular Arbok could change its pattern at any time to increase power to different stats and get invulnerability to status conditions, if the pattern is uncovered.

Arbok is territorial. It lashes out at intruders with long fangs tipped with deadly venom. Vengeful in nature, it will not give up a chase once it targets its prey or an opponent, no matter how far. It makes its home in grassy savannas and plains, but it can also be found in forests and desolate wastelands alongside its pre-evolved form Ekans. In the wild, it hunts smaller Pokémon, and also preys on Pidgey and Spearow Eggs. When hunting, it uses the pattern on its hood to immobilize prey, then it begins constricting them, and it finally poisons the target to finish them off and eat them. It is also capable of paralyzing opponents with its former signature move, Glare.

It is always female, has a black heart-shaped spot at the end of its tail, and can be dressed in any of five outfits corresponding to the five Contest conditions. The second form is Pikachu in a cap, which debuted as an event-exclusive Pokémon in Generation VII. It is always male and has seven variants, each wearing one of Ash's hats from the anime. In addition to these two forms, many other Pikachu variants have appeared in various media. The last, Partner Pikachu is the Pokémon the player starts with in Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!. This Pikachu can be either gender, has higher base stats, and has access to moves that normal Pikachu do not.

Pikachu is the only known Pokémon capable of using the Z-Move Catastropika, while Pikachu in a cap has its own exclusive Z-Move, 10,000,000 Volt Thunderbolt. Partner Pikachu is the only Pokémon capable of using Zippy Zap, Floaty Fall, Splishy Splash, and the Partner Power, Pika Papow. Pikachu is the only Pokémon capable of using the Light Ball item.

Raichu,26,Raichu is an Electric type Pokémon introduced in Generation 1. It is known as the Mouse Pokémon.,"Raichu is a bipedal, rodent-like Pokémon. Raichu is covered in dark orange fur with a white belly. Its bifurcated ears are brown on the outside, yellow on the insides, and end in a distinctive curl. There is a circular yellow marking on each cheek where its electric sacs are, and it has a triangular, dark brown nose. Its arms and feet have patches of brown fur at the end, and the soles of its long feet are tan with a circular orange pad in the center. On its back are two horizontal brown stripes. Its long, thin tail has a lightning bolt-shaped end. This lightning bolt is smaller on females. Raichu exudes a weak electrical charge from all its body and glows slightly in the dark.

Raichu's tail is used to gather electricity from the atmosphere, or it can be planted in the ground to search for electricity. It can store over 100,000 volts of electricity. If Raichu's sacs are fully charged, its ears will stand straight up and its muscles become stimulated. However, it will become aggressive if it has stored too much electricity. To keep from reaching this state, it discharges electricity through its tail into the ground. This leads to scorched patches near its nest. Being the result of an evolution via evolutionary stone, Raichu is rarely found in the wild, though they can be found in forests and woodlands. Like the two others in its evolutionary family, Raichu is able to learn Volt Tackle as a signature move.

In Alola, Raichu has lighter coloring and more rounded features. Its eyes are blue with yellow half-circles along the bottom. It has large yellow ears with an inner spiral toward the base and brown on the inside. These ears are thicker and less pointed than a standard Raichu's ear. In addition to its white belly, Alolan Raichu has white markings on its paws with bright yellow lines between its digits. The stripes on its back have also turned white, and there is a small, white circular marking on each heel. The lightning bolt-shaped tip of its tail has rounded edges. By collecting its psychic power in its tail, it is able to ride it like a surfboard and float in the air. While its cheek sacs are still used to store electricity, rubbing them releases a sweet aroma. This is also thought to be connected to its Psychic abilities. Raichu's transformation in Alola into Alolan Raichu is mostly a mystery, but the people of Alola suggest that it ate too many sweet and fluffy pancakes.[1] Researchers do believe the change is related to diet. Alolan Raichu is also sometimes called ""hodad"". It is the only known Pokémon capable of using the exclusive Z-Move Stoked Sparksurfer.

Sandshrew,27,Sandshrew is a Ground type Pokémon introduced in Generation 1. It is known as the Mouse Pokémon.,"Sandshrew is a bipedal mammalian Pokémon, but runs on all fours in the anime. Its brick-patterned yellow hide is dry, tough, blends in with desert sand, and protects its soft white underbelly and muzzle. Sandshrew has blue, almond-shaped eyes, a pointed snout, and triangular ears with white insides. Its tail is thick and conical. It has two long claws on each foot and three sharp claws on its forepaws, which are used to burrow.

Sandshrew spends much of its time hidden underground in deep burrows. It only emerges to lunge and drag in passing Bug-type Pokémon. Sandshrew can quickly curl into a tight ball to protect itself from great falls and opponents, but may also throw sand at attackers. While its body can efficiently absorb water to facilitate life in the desert, Sandshrew has been found in caves as well. If it is too wet, its skin becomes wrinkly. It dries itself out by using the geothermal heat near a volcano.

In the Alola region, Sandshrew migrated to snowy mountains due to the volcanic activity near the desert areas. Its body is a light, icy blue and with a cream-colored belly and muzzle. Thicker plates form a dome around its head and its ears resemble an igloo's entrances. In adapting to this cold climate, its body became larger and heavier with a shell of ice covering its hide. This steel-like covering grants it extra defense, but it is unable to curl into a ball like its desert counterpart. Predators, such as Weavile, exploit of its soft underbelly.

Sandslash,28,Sandslash is a Ground type Pokémon introduced in Generation 1. It is known as the Mouse Pokémon.,"Sandslash is a bipedal, ground dwelling pholidote Pokémon. Although Sandslash is usually bipedal, it can run on all fours. Most of its underside is light yellow with a white underbelly. It has a narrow muzzle, almond-shaped blue eyes, and a thick tail. Its back is mostly covered in sharp, brown quills formed from its tough, dry hide. It has two large claws on its paws and feet. These claws are its primary weapons and are used for slashing, but can also be used for burrowing. Its claws and spikes can both break off and are shed regularly, but grow back quickly. It can curl into a large ball, which allows it to roll to attack or escape, protect itself from heatstroke, and guard its belly. Sandslash is also adept at climbing trees and is prone to ambush its enemies from above. Sandslash can mostly be found in deserts.

In the Alola region, Sandslash has an icy blue hide and quills covered in ice. These quills stand taller than a regular Sandslash's quills and resemble icicles. This Pokémon uses its hide for camouflage in the snow, while leaving only its spines exposed. Its body emmits cold air, which sharpens its quills. Its forepaws are larger than its counterpart, and its claws are longer, thinner, and hooked at the tips. Formerly used for climbing trees, they now allow it scale an iceberg. Despite the weight of its ice-covered body, Alolan Sandslash is able to move swiftly by carving a path in the snow with its claws. This Pokémon tends to live in the deeper parts of snowy mountains, where climbing is forbidden. However, the sprays of snow it kicks up are popular shots for photographers.[1]

Zubat,41,Zubat is a Poison/Flying type Pokémon introduced in Generation 1. It is known as the Bat Pokémon.,"Zubat is a blue, bat-like Pokémon. While it lacks eyes, it has pointed ears with purple insides and a mouth with two sharp teeth on each jaw. A male will have larger fangs than a female. It has purple wing membranes supported by two, elongated fingers, and two long, thin, tails.

Zubat lives in abundance in caves. It has evolved to have neither eyes nor nostrils, instead navigating through dark environments with echolocation. As demonstrated in the anime, it will leave its abode at night with a mass of other Zubat in order to seek prey. During the daytime, Zubat sleeps hanging upside down in caves, forests, or under the eaves of old buildings, avoiding sunlight at all costs. Daylight causes Zubat to become unhealthy, and prolonged exposure can even burn its skin. However, captured and trained Zubat have been recorded as being much more tenacious in the daytime, even when directly exposed to sunbeams. In colder conditions, Zubat gathers with others of its kind for warmth.

While its mouth seems to be otherwise empty, Golbat occasionally displays a long, purple tongue. It has short legs with long feet.

Golbat's fangs have hollow tubes specialized for sucking blood. While they are strong enough to pierce thick hide, they are also unexpectedly fragile. It feeds on the blood of both Pokémon and humans and is capable of drinking over 10 ounces (300 milliliters) of blood in one sitting. Golbat drinks so much blood that its blood type will change to that of its victim following a feed. It is also gluttonous, occasionally gorging itself to the extent that it becomes too heavy to fly, leaving itself vulnerable in turn. Golbat is nocturnal and can be found quite easily in caves.

Oddish,43,Oddish is a Grass/Poison type Pokémon introduced in Generation 1. It is known as the Weed Pokémon.,"Oddish is a Pokémon that resembles a blue plant bulb. It has a round body, beady red eyes, a small mouth, and ovoid feet. Five large, green leaves sprout from its head. As demonstrated in the anime, these leaves are prehensile and can be used to scale vertical surfaces and catch light objects. Known by the scientific name Oddium Wanderus, Oddish lives in grasslands. A nocturnal Pokémon, Oddish buries its sensitive body in the ground during the day to avoid the sun and fool predators. If its leaves are pulled in this state, it will respond by shrieking horribly. It starts to move when its leaves begin absorbing moonlight, which it uses to grow. Oddish will wander up to 1000 feet (300 meters) during the night to scatter its seeds and find a nutrient-rich patch of soil in which to plant itself. The more fertile the earth, the glossier its leaves will be. It is thought that its feet become like tree roots while planted. In the past, Petal Dance was its signature move.

On its head is a flower with spherical petals surrounded by four reddish-brown leaves. The petals are a dark reddish-brown and have white spots. A female displays a single large spot on each petal, while a male will have many smaller spots. Gloom's eyes are wide and often appear closed and its lips are thin and purple.

Gloom trickles sticky nectar from its mouth with the appearance and consistency of drool. This can be used as a fertilizer for plants. Both this nectar and the flower on Gloom's head release a foul odor strong enough to induce fainting in humans over a mile (1.6 kilometers) away. However, it can also attract prey, and even a very small number of humans find it pleasing. This odor is a key ingredient for some perfume production. When it is in danger, the odor worsens, but it will not emit its odor if it feels safe. Gloom lives in grassy plains. In the past, Petal Dance was its signature move.

Vileplume's flower is said to have the largest petals in the world and is almost too heavy for the Pokémon itself to support. The rounded petals of the flower are red and covered with white spots. A female Vileplume has fewer, but larger, spots on its petals. It can shake, flap, or burst its petals into bloom with a bang in order to release clouds of pollen. This pollen is highly allergenic to humans and toxic to other Pokémon; Vileplume uses it to paralyze its prey. It can also utilize these petals in its former signature move, Petal Dance. Being the result of an evolution via evolutionary stone, Vileplume is rarely found in the wild, though they can be found in grassy plains. It is often mistaken for local flowers in the wild.

Its ovoid body is segmented, and it has three pairs of legs. The foremost pair of legs is the largest and has sharp claws at the tips. There are five specks on its forehead and three teeth on either side of its mouth. It has circular eyes with large pupils.

Red-and-yellow mushrooms known as tochukaso grow on this Pokémon's back. The mushrooms can be removed at any time and grow from spores that are doused on this Pokémon's back at birth by the mushroom on its mother's back. Tochukaso are parasitic in nature, drawing their nutrients from the host Paras's body in order to grow and exerting some command over the Pokémon's actions. For example, Paras drains nutrients from tree roots due to commands from the mushrooms. The mushrooms are also popular among collectors and have medicinal uses, usually involving extended life. The mushrooms are also the source of its former signature move, Spore.

The anime has shown that Paras can often be found in caves. However, it can also thrive in damp forests. In the Alola region, the mushrooms on its back do not grow well. This thought to be from a lack of moisture or nutrients.

The fungus growing on its back has a large red cap with yellow spots throughout.

The insect has been drained of nutrients and is now under the control of the fully-grown tochukaso. Removing the mushroom will cause Parasect to stop moving. It can thrive in dank forests with a suitable amount of humidity for growing fungi. Swarms of this Pokémon have been known to infest trees. The swarm will drain the tree of nutrients until it dies and will then move on to a new tree. It has been known to fight with Shiinotic over territory. Its former signature move is Spore.

There is also a pair of white antennae sprouting from the top of its head. However, the most prominent feature on its face are its large, red compound eyes. Venonat's highly developed eyes act as radar units and can shoot powerful beams.

Venonat can be found in dense temperate forests, where it will sleep in the hole of a tree until nightfall. It sleeps throughout the day because the small insects it feeds on appear only at night. Both Venonat and its prey are attracted to bright lights.

It has two pairs of pale purple moth-like wings with thin black venation. These wings are covered in dust-like scales that vary in color depending on their toxic capability. Dark scales are poisonous, while lighter scales can cause paralysis. These scales are released when Venomoth flutters its wings.

Venomoth lives in dense temperate forests with thick undergrowth and little light. As a nocturnal Pokémon, Venomoth comes out at night to hunt of its favorite prey. It prefers to feed on insects that gather around light, and Venomoth is attracted to bright lights itself.

A Diglett in Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team and Blue Rescue Team mentions that it has feet, though their size and appearance are unknown. It spends much of its time underground and has very thin skin. If Diglett is exposed to sunlight, its blood will heat up and cause it to grow weak.

Diglett lives in tunnels and caves under the earth, where it feeds on tree roots and vegetables. It also sometimes lives in burrows near forests and has even been shown to live inside of trees. Diglett digs regularly through the earth at a shallow depth, leaving perfectly tilled soil in its wake. Some farmers welcome Diglett because it tills their fields and its droppings enrich the soil, but others consider it a pest for eating their vegetables. For a brief time, Fissure was its signature move.

In a Alola, Diglett has developed three fine gold whiskers on its head from living in soil with high iron content. These whiskers function as sensors and allow it to monitor its surroundings without coming above ground, though it will still occasionally poke its head out to monitor its surroundings. The whiskers can also be used for communication, wobbling around to relay mood or emotion. They stand straight up for anger, swing around for happiness, and droop for sadness.[1] Needing to be able to dig through Alola's volcanic rock, Alolan Diglett is notably stronger than its non-Alolan counterparts.

Meowth,52,Meowth is a Normal type Pokémon introduced in Generation 1. It is known as the Scratch Cat Pokémon.,"Meowth is a small, feline Pokémon with cream-colored fur that turns brown at the tips of its hind paws and tail. Its ovoid head features four prominent whiskers, wide eyes with slit pupils, two pointed teeth in the upper jaw, and a gold koban coin embedded in its forehead. Its ears are black with brown interiors and are flanked with an additional pair of long whiskers. Meowth is a quadruped with the ability to walk on its hind legs; while the games always depict Meowth on two legs, the anime states that Meowth normally walks on all fours. It can freely manipulate its claws, retracting them when it wants to move silently. The tip of its tail curls tightly.

Meowth is attracted to round and shiny objects and has the unique ability to produce coins using Pay Day. Being nocturnal, it is known to wander about city streets at night and pick up anything that sparkles, including loose change. Upon finding a sparkling object, its eyes will glitter and the coin on its forehead will shine brightly. It shares this intrigue with Murkrow, with whom it often fights with for objects and prey. Meowth is a playful but fickle Pokémon with the capacity for human-like intelligence. At least one member of the species teaching itself how to speak. Meowth tends to live in urban areas.

Meowth was introduced to Alola as a gift to royalty.[1] The luxurious royal lifestyle soon led to Meowth diverging from its origins and becoming the selfish, prideful, and cunning Alolan Meowth. Alolan Meowth will turn hysterical if its coin or pride are besmirched. When the monarchy fell, the rare Alolan Meowth went feral and eventually grew as common in Alola as anywhere else. Alolan Meowth's fur is a light blue-gray color. Instead of brown markings, the tip of its tail, whiskers, digits, and the insides of its ears a whitish-gray. Alolan Meowth's whiskers have a slight curve compared to regular Meowth's straighter whiskers, and it has silvery eyes.

Persian,53,Persian is a Normal type Pokémon introduced in Generation 1. It is known as the Classy Cat Pokémon.,"Persian is a large, quadruped, feline Pokémon. Its fur is pale tan with the exception of its black-rimmed ears. It has a short muzzle with a small, black nose, red eyes with slit pupils, rounded ears, a pair of pointed teeth in its upper jaw, and three whiskers on either side of its face. Its thick whiskers are very sensitive to changes in air movements, enabling it to detect its prey by movement alone. In the center of its forehead is a red jewel. Its long tail has a distinctive curl at the end. Persian communicates with body language and holds its tail upright to signal its intention to pounce. It has long legs and three-toed paws with retractable claws. Persian's lithe muscles also enable it to walk without making a sound.

Persian normally lives in towns and cities. Although popular for its elegance, it is extremely difficult to raise as a pet due to its fickle and temperamental personality. It will scratch anyone, including its Trainer, with little or no provocation, and has been observed ripping its prey apart for no discernible reason. However, when Persian is yanked by its whiskers, it becomes temporarily docile for unknown reasons. It is popular among rich people and is targeted by hunters for its jewel. In the past, Pay Day was its signature move.

Alolan Persian has a body that is similar to its regular counterpart, but it has blue-gray fur. Its face has a different shape, being larger and more rounded with noticeable jowls. This distinctive face, along with its high-class softer-than-velvet fur coat, is admired by the people of Alola. Its eyes are usually in a half-closed state, and instead of a red forehead jewel, it has a blue jewel. The jewel, though different in appearance, is made of mostly the same material the one on a regular Persian. In behavior, it is described as highly intelligent and having an even higher opinion of itself. It prefers to use underhanded tactics in battle, but its haughty personality causes it to underestimate opponents.

On top of its head are three thick strands of black hair and it has a wide, flat cream-colored beak. Its eyes seem vacant and have tiny pupils. Its legs and tail are stubby, and it has cream-colored webbed feet. There are three claws on each of its hands.

Psyduck is constantly stunned by its headache and is unable to think very clearly. It usually stands immobile, trying to calm its headache. However, when its headache becomes too severe, it releases tension in the form of strong psychic powers. The use of these powers produces brain waves identical to those seen in sleepers, and the Pokémon is unable to recall these episodes. Psyduck lives in freshwater lakes and small ponds, but can be seen in rivers in tropical areas as shown in Pokémon Snap.

Golduck,55,Golduck is a Water type Pokémon introduced in Generation 1. It is known as the Duck Pokémon.,"Golduck is a blue, bipedal, duck-like Pokémon. It has red eyes, a cream-colored beak, a red gem in the center of its forehead, and four spikes on the back of its head. Its hands and feet all have three clawed digits with cream-colored webbing in-between. Its body is especially adapted to have a hydrodynamic shape, and it has a long tail that it uses as a rudder to steer. Golduck is sometimes mistaken for the Japanese monster, and physical inspiration for Golduck, the Kappa due to its bluish color, general body shape, and webbed hands and feet.

Golduck is a fast swimmer, out-swimming even the most athletic of humans because of its webbed appendages. Even rough seas do not hamper this Pokémon's swimming abilities, and it will sometimes rescue people from shipwrecks. The gem on its forehead glows when it uses its psychic powers, and occasionally when it swims at full speed. In the past, this Pokémon was overhunted due to the belief that the gem granted people supernatural powers. As seen in the manga, Golduck has the ability to give knowledge to its Trainer and fellow Pokémon through telepathy. Golduck can typically be seen swimming in lakes, where it hunts fish. The prey is disabled, captured, and then brought to shore for consumption.

Mankey,56,Mankey is a Fighting type Pokémon introduced in Generation 1. It is known as the Pig Monkey Pokémon.,"Mankey is a simian Pokémon, similar to a New World monkey. It is a bipedal and has a round body covered in whitish, shaggy fur. Its nose is similar to a pig's snout, and it has narrow, red eyes and triangular ears with brown insides. Mankey's three-fingered hands, two-toed feet, and the tip of its curved, prehensile tail are brown. Along with Stufful, it is the smallest Fighting-type.

Mankey specializes in physical fighting and is very aggressive and short-tempered. When angry, Mankey begins shaking and its breathing turns rough. Its rage peaks quickly, preventing its victim from being able to flee. It will rampage until it falls asleep, but its anger remains in its dreams. This causes it to wake up and become furious all over again. However, this constant release of stress grants it a long life. Mankey can be found in the mountains, where it lives in treetop colonies. If one becomes enraged, the whole colony rampages for no reason. If it loses sight of its colony or if it is left alone to rage, its loneliness causes it to become infuriated.

According to the Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team and Blue Rescue Team games, Mankey's preferred food is chestnuts. However, Mankey usually lacks the dexterity to peel them. It becomes agitated and rage after attempting to peel a chestnut's spiky shell. Additionally, it also appears to be fond of bananas in the anime.

Primeape,57,Primeape is a Fighting type Pokémon introduced in Generation 1. It is known as the Pig Monkey Pokémon.,"Primeape is a bipedal, simian Pokémon with a round body covered in whitish, shaggy fur. There is usually a throbbing vein on the left side of its forehead, and it has triangular ears with pink insides, narrow eyes with tiny pupils, and a pink, snout-like nose. Its arms and legs are brown and have metal shackles on the wrists and ankles. This is probably indicative of a method of training with weights. The hands have no visible fingers, instead resembling mittens or boxing gloves, and the feet have two toes.

Primeape is easily angered; even the slightest glance of eye contact will make it furious. When Primeape is furious, its blood circulation is boosted. This makes its muscles stronger, but at the cost of some of its intelligence. However, it has sturdy vessels in its brain that help keep it healthy. It will chase anyone who upsets it and will not stop until it has caught its quarry. Even if it is awoken from sleep, it will groggily chase whatever woke it. It has shown some fondness for bananas. Primeape can be found on mountains.

It has orange fur with black stripes along its back and legs. The fur on its muzzle, chest, belly, and tail is beige, as well as an additional tuft of fur on top of its head. Growlithe's coat is noticeably longer on its chest and tail. It has gray eyes, a black nose, and large, round ears with beige interiors. Its forepaws have two visible claws, while its hind paws have three toes each. Each paw has a brown pad.

Growlithe is a friendly and loyal Pokémon that will fearlessly defend its Trainer and territory from harm, even against larger, stronger enemies. In particular, it has been known to fight with Rockruff over territory. It will fiercely bark at, bite, and chase away any perceived threat. Otherwise, this obedient Pokémon will wait motionlessly until given an order. It has a long history with people, as its bones have been found in Stone Age ruins. In the wild, Growlithe can be commonly found in grassy plains.

Growlithe also has a powerful olfactory sense. If it detects an unknown smell in its territory, it roars to flush out the intruder. It is able to smell the emotions of others, and never forgets a scent. However, strong, unpleasant smells can disable its sense of smell for short periods, as seen in the anime.

It has diamond-shaped ears with beige insides, black eyes, a round, black nose, and two pointed teeth protruding from its upper jaw. Its head, muzzle, and chest are covered in shaggy, beige fur, except for two oval sections around each eye and ear. Long tufts of fur grow behind its elbows and around its ankles. Its underside is black, and it has a billowing, beige tail that is bent in the middle. Each paw has three toes and a round, pink pad.

Arcanine is a fiercely brave and loyal Pokémon. It is capable of running 6,200 miles (10,000 kilometers) in 24 hours with a speed and grace reminiscent of flight. Additionally, the move Extreme Speed was its signature move in the past. Arcanine has long been admired for its beauty and speed, and anyone who hears its bark will grovel before it. The source of its power is a flame blazing wildly inside its body. Being the result of an evolution via evolutionary stone, Arcanine is rarely found in the wild, but when found, it is usually seen living in prairies, and Pokémon Snap has also shown it living in active volcanoes. In the anime, it was shown that it stashes food in its mane and carries it to its nest for its young.

The direction of the belly spiral differs by area; the equator is thought to have an effect on it. It has newly developed legs that are poor at walking and no arms. It has a long, thin tail surrounded by a light blue, semitransparent fin. Its tail makes it a powerful swimmer. Because of its ineptitude on land, Poliwag is more likely to be found swimming in small freshwater ponds and lakes. In the anime, Poliwag feeds on salveyo weed, which can only be found on clear lake bottoms.

Poliwhirl,61,Poliwhirl is a Water type Pokémon introduced in Generation 1. It is known as the Tadpole Pokémon.,"Poliwhirl is a blue, bipedal Pokémon with a spherical body. It has bulbous eyes that protrude from the top of its head. A black and white swirl covers its belly, which is actually its organs showing through its thin skin. It appears to have white gloves on its hands and rounded, digit-less feet. When out of water, it sweats to keep its skin moist and healthy. This keeps it covered in an oily fluid that allows it to slip away from enemies. All of its skin feels this way except where its swirl is, which is instead very smooth. The swirl on its belly undulates slowly and staring at it induces drowsiness.

While Poliwhirl is capable of moving on land, it prefers to stay in freshwater ponds and lakes where it has fewer natural enemies. It feeds on both bug and fish Pokémon. While it will leave the water to capture bug Pokémon, it will return and consume them underwater in safety.

When it swims, it uses all the muscles in its body and is able to swim vast distances with minimal breathing. It is even capable of briefly running on the water's surface. Being the result of an evolution via evolutionary stone, Poliwrath is rarely found in the wild, but when found, it is usually seen living on dry land near the water's edge, despite it being an excellent swimmer.

Its tail is thick and long, with a brown band located near the tip.

Abra can sense danger through a telepathic radar. When it does, it teleports to a safe location. However, it sometimes becomes panicked if it wakes in an unknown location. By hypnotizing itself, Abra is able to teleport itself even while sleeping. It can use other extrasensory abilities while sleeping as well and can even teleport into the treetops to pick and eat berries. Due to the strain of its telepathic powers, however, Abra sleeps 18 hours each day. If it fails to rest long enough, it will become unable to use its powers. Abra lives in urban areas, but has been observed to teleport to a different location once per hour. If it teleports randomly, it can create illusory copies.

Attached to the Pokémon's abdomen is a large, thick tail encircled with a brown band near its base. Its arms are thin with brown elbows and end in three-fingered hands with white claws. Its legs have prominent knees and large, three-toed feet, also ending in white claws. Two of its toes face forward and one backward. Kadabra is always seen carrying a silver spoon, which amplifies its telekinetic powers. A gold spoon does not work as an amplifier and Kadabra is only half as strong without a spoon. It is able to bend its spoon to use Kinesis, its signature move.

Kadabra emits alpha waves strong enough to induce headaches, and can even cause clocks to run backwards, machines to malfunction, and delicate devices to cease functioning altogether. The waves increase further in strength the more danger Kadabra faces. By closing its eyes, it can double the number of alpha particles it emits. When it has a headache, the alpha waves become unusual. All of Kadabra's brain cells work in unison while it uses its powers. Kadabra lives in urban areas.

A female Alakazam has a significantly shorter mustache than a male. It has a long, thin snout, narrow eyes, ear-like spikes extending from the top of its head, and an additional spike protruding from each cheek. Covering its yellow, skeletal body are brown armor-like sections over its chest, shoulders, forearms and knees. There are three toes on each foot, each of which has a white claw. Two of the toes face forward, while one faces backwards. It wields a silver spoon in each hand, which act as amplifiers for its psychic abilities. The spoons are created using its psychic powers and it may give one to someone it trusts. Alakazam is able to lower the accuracy of its opponents by bending the spoons it wields, using its signature move Kinesis.

As Mega Alakazam, its mustache turns white and becomes longer and bushier. It also grows a long, white beard. The armor-like sections become bulkier, and its upper body section becomes slightly shorter to reveal its thin stomach. The ear-like spikes become slightly shorter and a larger spike forms on top of its head. Additionally, it gains an oval, red organ in the center of its forehead. The organ is said to emit psychic power. Its lower legs become longer and slimmer and its feet become skinnier and resemble talons. It gains three additional spoons, for a total of five that it levitates in the air. At the cost of its already-low muscular strength, Mega Alakazam's power is entirely converted to pure psychic energy. It can read the course of a person's entire life with a single glance.

Alakazam is able to use all forms of psychic abilities. The overflow of its psychic powers can cause headaches to those nearby. These powers are used to move its body, as opposed to its weak muscles. It also uses its psychic powers to hold up its head, which is too heavy to be supported by its neck. Due to its continually growing brain its head becomes larger with age. It is said to have an excellent memory and can remember everything that it has experienced since hatching as an Abra, and has an IQ that exceeds 5,000. It is found in urban areas.

It can be found in small groups and is territorial. In the manga, Victreebel hoards food, usually small birds and rodents, and collects Leaf Stones to perform evolution rituals at night to help Weepinbell become more Victreebel. Being the result of an evolution via evolutionary stone, Victreebel is rarely found in the wild, though they can be found in temperate forests and jungles.

Tentacool,72,Tentacool is a Water/Poison type Pokémon introduced in Generation 1. It is known as the Jellyfish Pokémon.,"Tentacool is a small, jellyfish-like Pokémon. It has a light blue, clear body with two large, transparent, red crystals on each side of its body and one small one in the middle. Near the base of its body is a pointed, beak-like projection and two eyes with small pupils. There are two grayish tentacles extending from beneath its round lower body, which has a cape-like formation on the back.

Tentacool's entire body is made of 99% water and the remaining 1% contains the organ that makes its poison. It absorbs sunlight and refracts it using the water inside its body to convert it into beam energy. Its tentacles are laced with stinging cells and, as seen in the anime, it can control Pokémon it touches with its tentacles. The tentacles break off occasionally, but can regenerate. Tentacool travel throughout the world using ocean currents. It will sometimes wash ashore and shrivel up due to dehydration, though it remains equally as dangerous. Tentacool may be revived if thrown back into the sea.

It has clear, light blue body that has two large, red orbs on either side and smaller orb in the center. Its eyes are visible in its round lower body, which is black. Extending from its lower body are two blue, beak like appendages and numerous grayish tentacles. Its red orbs glow whenever it is excited or agitated, and it may alert others to danger by stridently flashing them. They are also capable of refracting sunlight, storing energy, and firing ultrasonic waves.

Tentacruel's primarily light blue body helps it camouflage in the water. It has a total of 80 tentacles, which it can readily extend during hunts to ensnare its prey before immobilizing it with poison. Its tentacles can absorb water to stretch even further. Most of these tentacles are hidden and kept short, leaving up to 14 exposed. However, it tends to lose tentacles as it ages. Tentacruel lives in underwater rock formations and can be found throughout the ocean.

Geodude,74,Geodude is a Rock/Ground type Pokémon introduced in Generation 1. It is known as the Rock Pokémon.,"Geodude is a gray boulder Pokémon. It has bulging, rocky eyebrows, trapezoidal, brown eyes and a wide mouth. Its arms are muscular with five-fingered hands. Geodude uses its arms to climb steadily up steep mountain paths. It is proud of its sturdy body and will bash against others of its kind in a contest of sorts to prove whose body is harder. The longer it lives, the more chipped and worn its body becomes. Eventually, it will be completely smooth and round. As a result of their physical appearance, Rhyperior mistake this Pokémon for actual boulders and fire them through their hands.

Geodude can be most often found on mountain trails and fields. It will sit still in these areas, which is why it is often mistaken for a rock. It is often stepped on and will sometimes swing its arms in anger when this occurs. When Geodude sleeps deeply, it buries itself halfway into the ground. Once buried, it will not awaken even if someone steps on it. In the morning, Geodude rolls downhill in search of food.

In the Alola region, Geodude is made from a magnetic rock with a more silvery appearance. There are areas on Alolan Geodude's body that are especially magnetic and attract iron sand, creating the appearance of black eyebrows and strands of short black hair. Its fingers are fused together, leaving only the thumb and index finger free. Stepping on Alolan Geodude results in an electrical shock and sometimes an angry headbutt. Like regular Geodude, it competes with others by bashing their bodies together. The iron sand sticks to the one with stronger magnetism. The Alolan Golem will fire these Geodude if real rocks are absent.

Graveler,75,Graveler is a Rock/Ground type Pokémon introduced in Generation 1. It is known as the Rock Pokémon.,"Graveler is a bipedal, boulder Pokémon. Its round body is covered with small bumps and it has a rocky crest above its small eyes and mouth. It has four arms, each with a three-fingered hand. Its second pair of arms is typically kept tucked against its chest. It was shown in Pokémon Snap that, despite having legs, it can revert to a legless form. This grants it the ability to float.

Graveler's preferred locomotion is rolling, specifically because it is a slow walker. It often rolls down mountain paths at high speeds, crushing objects in the way and stopping by running into huge rocks. However, it will explode if it rolls into a river instead. If it breaks or shatters, it has the ability to restore itself overtime. Graveler climbs a mountain from base to summit, feasting on rocks all the while. Upon reaching the peak, it rolls down to the bottom. Graveler can be often found on mountain trails.

In the Alola region, Graveler looks similar to its regular counterpart, but with a silvery sheen. It lacks defined digits on its upper limbs and has two toes on each foot rather than three. There are several small, yellowish crystals scattered across its body and iron sand attracted by magnetism. This black sand creates crystal-like formations above its eyes, across the tops of the upper pair of arms, and on the sides of its face. Alolan Graveler feeds on dravite, which creates the yellow crystals on its body and grant it electrical abilities. It often fights with others over food, and when two smash together it creates a flash of light and a booming sound.

Golem,76,Golem is a Rock/Ground type Pokémon introduced in Generation 1. It is known as the Megaton Pokémon.,"Golem is a bipedal Pokémon with a spherical body covered by a shell of plated, green rocks. Its body is so hard that even dynamite cannot scratch it. Its head protrudes from center of the shell. The head has a flat snout with two pointed teeth in the lower jaw and red eyes. It has short arms that have three claws and two legs with feet that have four claws in front and one in back. The head and limbs are a light brown. Golem grows bigger by shedding its skin once a year. The discarded shell immediately hardens when exposed to air, crumbling away and returning to the soil. However, it stops shedding with age and moss grows over its shell. As shown in the Pocket Monsters Carddass Trading Cards, Golem's shell is hollow.

The anime has shown that Golem is able to withdraw its head and limbs into its shell and roll at high speeds. It is dangerous when doing this, as it is unable to see and may crash into or run over anything in its path. To prevent it from rolling into the homes of people downhill, grooves are dug into the sides of the mountains to divert the rolling Golem's course. It is seldom seen in the wild. However, it can be found living in mountainous regions.

In the Alola region, Golem has much shorter forearms with two claws. The feet have only two claws as well. Its face attracts iron sand, creating the appearance of a mustache, eyebrows and a large black beard. Jutting out of the top of its body are two large, black rocks with a smaller rock in-between. On the inner edge of the larger rocks are three golden dots. Alolan Golem is capable of firing the small rock by using magnetism. The rock will be electrically charged, creating shocks across the whole area of impact. Numbness and fainting can occur with even a glancing blow. If rocks are not available, it will fire nearby Geodude instead.

It has four long legs, each ending in a single, gray hoof. These hooves are said to be harder than diamonds.

Ponyta has extraordinary jumping abilities and is capable of leaping tall buildings in a single bound. However, a newborn Ponyta is a weak runner and is actually barely able to stand. It gradually strengthens its legs and becomes faster by chasing after its parents. In the anime, it is shown that Ponyta can control its flames so that its rider is not burned by them.

Rapidash is a very agile Pokémon. It runs at about 150 mph (240 km/h), chasing everything that moves in hopes of racing it. With incredible acceleration, it reaches its top speed in only ten steps. At full gallop, its hooves barely touch the ground. The faster Rapidash goes, the longer the swaying flames of its mane will become.

It has vacant eyes that never seem focused, curled ears, and a rounded, tan muzzle. It has four legs, each of which ends in a single white claw. Its long, tapering tail has a white tip. This tail drips a sweet, sappy substance that is attractive to many species of fish. Slowpoke uses the tail as a fishing lure. The tail often breaks off, but it will grow back. In Alola, its tail is often dried and used in home cooked stews.

Slowpoke has notoriously dim intellect, and often forgets what it was doing. It takes a long time to respond to outside stimuli. For example, it can take up to five seconds to process pain and can take an entire day to notice when its tail has been bitten. Slowpoke is commonly found at the water's edge. In some places, it is believed that Slowpoke's yawn causes rain. This Pokémon is worshiped in those areas.

There is a Shellder attached to its tail. This Shellder has a gray, spiral shell with darker gray spots and small eyes near the base. There are several spikes across the surface of the Shellder, and it holds onto Slowbro with many sharp teeth. Shellder developed its spiral form in an effort to suck more sweetness out of Slowbro's tail. If its tail or the Shellder attached to it is broken off, Slowbro will revert to its unevolved form, Slowpoke.

Slowbro has lost the capability to feel pain due to the Shellder's poison. However, it apparently becomes inspired when the Shellder bites down on its tail. While it is capable of unleashing powerful psychic attacks, Slowbro is typically rather peaceful and usually prefers not to fight. Because it can no longer fish using its tail, it instead swims to catch its prey and allows the Shellder to feed on its leftover scraps. Slowbro tends to live near ponds, lakes, and seashores.

When Slowbro Mega Evolves, it becomes engulfed by the Shellder so that only its head, arms, and white-tipped tail are visible. Its head pokes out of the mouth of the Shellder and is surrounded by Shellder's now larger teeth. The spiral Shellder now has an opening at its tip, allowing the tail of Slowbro to stick out. Mega Slowbro balances on its tail due to its legs being engulfed. It can move by bouncing, using its tail as a spring. The spikes on the Shellder are now reduced to four on the bottom section of its body and the dark spots only visible on its middle section. Mega Slowbro's energy has gathered into Shellder, which has increased its hardness. This allows it to act as an armor so hard that nothing can scratch it. Slowpoke is virtually unchanged, but it gains some power and motivation from Shellder's digestive fluids.

Magnemite,81,Magnemite is an Electric/Steel type Pokémon introduced in Generation 1. It is known as the Magnet Pokémon.,"Magnemite is a seemingly robotic Pokémon that has a gray, spherical metal body with blue-and-red tipped horseshoe magnets on each side and a single, large eye. It has three Phillips head screws on its body: two near the bottom of its body and the one on top of its head that looks similar to an antenna. The two bottom screws serve no noticeable purpose, although they may be its feet as the Pokédex identifies a footprint similar to that of the screw's head. Even though Magnemite and its evolved forms are mechanical creatures, the anime has shown that it has emotions and a way of reproducing. It has even exhibited the need to eat, although its main form of nutrients is electrical currents. It is commonly found in locations such as power plants or caves with a strong magnetic field. Despite its modern, artificial appearance, Magnemite has been depicted in carvings discovered at the Ruins of Alph and has been present in AZ's retelling of the Kalos war, indicating it has existed for at least 3,000 years.

The magnetic units on Magnemite's body create electromagnetic waves that allow it to defy gravity and can potentially disrupt electrical equipment. Magnemite is not known to be unnecessarily aggressive, but may approach Trainers with little notice. If a wild Magnemite is approached, it may simply flee on rare occasions, as Magnemite does not care for interaction. However, if attacked, it will start retaliation with non-damaging moves. In the care of a Trainer, it can be a devoted fighter. However, it has been demonstrated that it may be deterred unless a strong bond is formed with its Trainer.

Magnemite can be attracted to anything emitting electricity or a magnetic field, including gadgets such as a Pokétch. It has even been shown to be attracted to electric Pokémon producing such fields. With modern electrical lines buried underground, Magnemite attacks on power plants have increased. To prevent power outages, these power plants deliberately send out signals Magnemite cannot stand to ward them off.

Magneton,82,Magneton is an Electric/Steel type Pokémon introduced in Generation 1. It is known as the Magnet Pokémon.,"Magneton is the result of three Magnemite becoming linked together by a strong magnetic force, although a single Magnemite can evolve by itself when no other Magnemite are in the vicinity. Each individual Magnemite has a gray spherical body with a single eye, a gray and red-and-blue tipped horseshoe magnet on each side. The topmost Magnemite has three Phillips head screws on its body, while the others appear to have only two. The three Magnemite that Magneton consists of can be linked several ways. Magneton is most commonly seen as one Magnemite on top, and two Magnemite linked by the screws on the bottom, forming a triangle. In some cases, commonly seen in 3D games such as Pokémon Snap, the Magnemite will not be connected at all, remain in a triangular formation at rest, and are able to freely move within each other's vicinity to form other patterns. In this case, all three Magnemite have three screws. The magnetic forces that holds the three Magnemite together is powerful enough to dry up all moisture and raise the temperature 3.6°F (2°C) within a 3,300 foot (1,000 meter) radius. It can also be disruptive to electronic devices.

Being composed of three Magnemite, it is about three times as powerful electrically, though not three times as intelligent. Even though Magneton is a mechanical creature, it still has the need to eat. As seen in the anime, food for Magneton consists of electrical currents. It is usually found in rough terrain, often near power plants. When sunspots flare up, Magneton tends to appear more often, presumably due to the changes in the sun's magnetic field. When rain clouds form, it also gathers in high areas prone to lightning strikes. It has been shown in the manga that it possesses the ability to form its electricity into both platforms and barriers. Despite its modern, artificial appearance, carvings depicting Magneton have been discovered at the Ruins of Alph, and one was shown in a flashback to the great war of Kalos, indicating it has existed for at least 3000 years.

Farfetch'd,83,Farfetch'd is a Normal/Flying type Pokémon introduced in Generation 1.

It has a flat, yellow beak, brown eyes, a V-shaped black marking on its forehead, and a three-feather crest on top of its head. Its wings are as big as its body and appear to be prehensile enough to substitute for hands. It has yellow legs with webbed feet and a stubby tail.

Farfetch'd is always seen carrying a leek stalk or spring onion. It carries this sprig in its wings, but sometimes chooses to hold it in its beak or feet instead. Unable to live without its stick, Farfetch'd will defend the stalk with its life. Known uses for the stick include use as a weapon, nesting material, and emergency food source. It is selective about which sticks it will use and has been known to fight over good ones. It is also the only Pokémon capable of using the Stick item. Farfetch'd is found in temperate grasslands.

Doduo,84,Doduo is a Normal/Flying type Pokémon introduced in Generation 1. It is known as the Twin Bird Pokémon.,"Doduo is a two-headed, bipedal avian Pokémon. Each head has a long sharp beak and two beady black eyes. It has a bristly, down-like covering of brown feathers on its body and both heads. A male has black flexible necks, whereas a female has brown necks; both genders have brown legs. Each foot has four digits ending in a sharp claw. Both heads have an identical brain. However, it is believed that on occasion they may possess different brains. It is also theorized that the two heads communicate with some form of telepathy for coordination. Even when sleeping or nourishing itself with food and water, one head is always awake and alert and keeps a keen eye out for enemies.

Due to its almost non-existent wings, it cannot fly very well. However, it has developed legs that make it a powerful runner. Reaching speeds of 60 mph (96.5 km/h), it energetically strides across the plains leaving large 4 inch (10.6 centimeter) deep foot prints behind it. By raising and lowering its two heads, it is better able to maintain balance while running. Doduo lives in wide open plains, grasslands, and savannahs.

Dodrio,85,Dodrio is a Normal/Flying type Pokémon introduced in Generation 1. It is known as the Triple Bird Pokémon.,"Dodrio is a large, wingless, three-headed avian Pokémon. Each head has a long, sharp beak and a black V-shaped, feather crest. It has bristly brown feathers covering its heads and upper body, while its lower half has a smooth layer of black feathers. Its tail consists of three pale red feathers with lighter tips. Its wingless body rests on two long and slender, but powerful legs with feet that have three clawed toes in front and one in back. A male has black necks, whereas a female has brown necks; both genders have brown legs.

Each head has its own working brain and distinct personality. Each  head represents and expresses either sorrow, anger, or joy. Despite being separate, it has the innate ability to use all three of its brains to collect data, formulate, and then execute complex plans and strategies. However, on occasion it may overthink, which causes it to become immobilized and unable to carry out any action whatsoever. Being separate individuals on the same body, the three heads will continue to bicker until they, or at least one of the heads gets to eat. This satisfies the other two heads, quelling them and temporarily ending their infighting. Another form of adaptation that it has acquired is the ability to have at least one head alert at all times. Extreme caution is advised when all three heads are facing separate directions. It is in this state that it is the most dangerous and going near it may result in a severe pecking.

Along with its three heads, it has three sets of hearts and lungs as well. This allows it to efficiently oxygenate and pump blood throughout its body, thus giving it increased endurance to run vast distances without rest. It is especially prone to race vigorously across grassy plains, even in arid seasons with little rainfall.

Seel,86,Seel is a Water type Pokémon introduced in Generation 1. It is known as the Sea Lion Pokémon.,"Seel is a pinniped Pokémon with a thick hide covered in bluish white fur. It has a pale tan maw with a large red tongue and a pair of tusks on its lower jaw. It has circular eyes and a black nose that is capable of closing when it swims. There is a small horn on its forehead, which it uses in combination with its tusks to bore through ice floes. It has two flippers on its chest, and two more on the end of its tail. When the tail is raised, it resembles a waterspout.

Seel lives on icebergs in frigid ocean waters. Its warm fur and thick hide allow it to swim in waters as cold as -40° Fahrenheit (-40° Celsius). It thrives in these cold environments, becoming more active as the temperature drops and tires easily in warm waters. Preferring to sleep during the day, it hunts for prey under sheets of ice in the late day and evening hours. While it is a graceful swimmer, it is awkward and struggles to move on dry land.

Its fur renders it virtually invisible in snowy conditions. Its face has two black eyes, a black nose, and two tusks extending from its upper jaw. It has a streamlined body with two front flippers and a long flowing tail. Even in extremely cold and ice-packed waters, its tail allows it to be a swift and agile swimmer at speeds of 8 knots. On top of its head is a sharp horn, which allows it to cut through the thickest ice floes.

It lives on icebergs adrift in frigid ocean waters. It thrives in lower temperatures, becoming increasingly more active the colder the weather. By storing thermal energy within its body, it is completely unharmed by even the most intense freezing weather. During daylight hours, it sleeps on bitterly cold ice or under shallow water. However, at night when the temperature drops, it becomes a hunter and searches for prey such as Wishiwashi. Following a meal, it sunbathes on the beach. This raises its body temperature and aids in digestion.

Grimer,88,Grimer is a Poison type Pokémon introduced in Generation 1. It is known as the Sludge Pokémon.,"Grimer is a slimy, amorphous Pokémon whose body was animated because of lunar radiation. It has two large eyes with beady pupils and a gaping mouth with a gray tongue. While it lacks any visible legs, it does have two arms with three digits on each hand. Its purple sludge body contains a variety of pungent bacteria, which are so potent that it renders soil barren and incapable of supporting plant life. It is constantly oozing a bacteria-rich fluid from all parts of its body. Pieces of it often break off during travel, and go on to become new Grimer. When combined with another Grimer, it produces new poisonous compounds.

Due to its lack of a solid form, Grimer is capable of squeezing into any space or crevices with relative ease. It uses this to penetrate sewage pipes and feed off of the filthy waste water inside. Its population fluctuates based on the availability of waste. It can be found in polluted lakes and streams, as well as within cities and factories where trash and industrial waste can be found.

Grimer was brought to Alola to deal with the excess waste generated by the region's increased population. Alolan Grimer eats solid garbage instead of sludge; this new diet has caused its body composition and form to change. Alolan Grimer's body is green with a line of yellow sludge along its lower lip that extends around behind its head, a bright blue tongue, and a small black space behind its eyes. It also has two blunt ""teeth"" in its upper jaw, which are actually crystallized toxins formed by its diet. It is not known how to break down these toxic crystals, but direct contact with them is known to be dangerous. Lethal poisons leak out of Grimer's body when these crystals fall out. Because it produces and stores its toxins within its body, Alolan Grimer does not produce a foul stench like the standard version.[1]

Alolan Grimer is perpetually hungry and must constantly eat trash. If no trash is readily available, it will eat other manufactured products instead.[2] In addition to garbage, Alolan Grimer preys on Trubbish and Garbodor; its introduction to Alola caused their populations to decrease in the region.

Muk,89,Muk is a Poison type Pokémon introduced in Generation 1. It is known as the Sludge Pokémon.,"Muk is a large, sticky, amorphous Pokémon made of living purple sludge. It has two small eyes with beady black pupils. It also has an enormous mouth with a gray tongue and strands of ooze connecting its top and bottom jaws. While it has no visible legs, it does have two arms with three fingers on each hand. However, it typically keeps one hand tucked in while it extends the other hand.

Muk is a living biohazard, leaking toxins that instantly kill all plant life it touches. Even it being in close proximity to plants will cause them to wilt and die. Extreme caution is advised in avoiding any contact with this Pokémon, as an accidental brush up can lead to severe sickness. The effects of this Pokémon can leave the landscape barren for three years. In dirty residential areas where people throw trash into the streets, it is almost certain to appear. It will readily consume nearly any waste or refuse generated by people and Pokémon alike. It can be found in heavily polluted bodies of water, cities and factories. However, Muk's population has declined due to recent environmental improvements and extermination efforts. This has led some to believe that it will go extinct at some point; sludge ponds are being built to prevent its extinction.

Alolan Muk has a more vibrant coloration, consisting of green, pink, and yellow stripes with thin blue bands in-between. The green, yellow, and pink stripes are capable of shifting downwards while the blue stays in place. It has various white, crystallized poison shards protruding from parts of its body, especially from its mouth and fingers, giving the impression of claws and fangs. It has blue eyes with a black space behind them and a bright blue tongue. Its vivid coloration is a result of the garbage it eats, which causes chemical changes in its body. Its body contains over a hundred different kinds of poisons.

Alolan Muk's unexpectedly quiet and friendly. However, if it is not fed trash for a while, its hunger will compel it to destroy its Trainer's furnishings for food. It is thought that it cannot maintain its energy with a constant source of toxins, which causes its voracious appetite. The crystals covering its body have a tendency to break off, which makes it extremely difficult to deal with due to the concentrated toxins contained within them. This variant of Muk does not produce the foul stench due to its toxins being contained in with its body.[1] Alolan Muk preys on Trubbish and Garbodor.

Shellder,90,Shellder is a Water type Pokémon introduced in Generation 1. It is known as the Bivalve Pokémon.,"Shellder is a black pearl-like Pokémon encased within a spiky, blue-violet bivalve shell. It has two round white eyes with tiny black pupils. Its enormously long red tongue is used to burrow itself into sand to sleep overnight and also to lure and capture prey. The tongue protrudes even when its shell is closed and tugging it will cause the shell to pop open. Its soft and tender body is well-protected by its extremely durable shell, which is purported to be harder than diamonds and has historically been used by people to make shields. It can make pearls from accumulated sand, though it discards them as they are typically in its way.

Shellder has an unusually strong appetite for the tail of a Slowpoke and can develop a symbiotic relationship with the Dopey Pokémon. After attaching itself to the Slowpoke's tail, the two undergo a metamorphosis and together evolve into Slowbro. Alternatively, if it attaches to the head of a Slowpoke in possession of a King's Rock, the two will instead evolve into Slowking. These relationships allow it to travel onto land and begin a new stage in its life cycle.

Regardless of which form the two Pokémon evolve into, Shellder's shell transforms into a spiny, spiraled cone with several tiers. Sharp teeth develop around the rim of the shell to anchor it securely to the evolved Slowpoke, and its eyes now peek out from the bottom rim of the shell. In its crown form, Shellder will have a red jewel on its underside and a large horn on either side of its shell.

While in its crown form, Shellder will periodically release its venom into Slowking's brain. This is actually beneficial to Slowking, as it causes the Regal Pokémon's intelligence to increase. Higher quantities of venom intensify this effect, and Shellder is easily provoked into releasing more whenever Slowking yawns. However, Shellder's poison makes Slowbro more sluggish as it continues to drain nutrients from its host's body.

Shellder has two former signature moves. It can shoot spears of ice by using Icicle Spear, or clamp tightly to its opponents using Clamp. Despite its hard shell, clamping on to an opponent will reveal its vulnerable parts. Because of this, it will only clamp itself to a foe as a last resort. It swims around its seafloor home by rapidly opening and closing its shell while facing backward. Prehistoric Shellder were apparently preyed upon by Omastar, whose powerful bites were capable of breaking through its shell. Kingler, Rufflet, and Bruxish are modern predators of Shellder.

Cloyster,91,Cloyster is a Water/Ice type Pokémon introduced in Generation 1. It is known as the Bivalve Pokémon.,"Cloyster is a black, pearl-like Pokémon. It is encased inside a light-gray shell, which is surrounded by a second jagged, blue-violet outer shell casing. It has one barb-like spike protruding from above its head, and multiple conical horns on its outer shell. Its shell is harder than diamond with spikes that are even harder; harsh tidal currents will affect the size and sharpness of these spikes. On its pearl-like face, it has two white eyes and a mouth. Aside from its face and head, its internal anatomy has never been seen. Once it has shut itself in, it is impossible to open its shell from the outside. This impressive defense allows it to withstand anything from a bomb blast to even a missile strike.

Cloyster typically only opens its shell to attack an opponent. However, it is fully capable of retaliating against any enemy with its shell tightly closed. With rapid succession, it launches its spikes at the foe, keeping them repelled. It can also attack by clamping onto an enemy with its former signature move, Clamp. The same projectile system it uses to launch its spikes is also used for swimming. It swallows seawater, and then ejects it towards the rear propelling it through with siphon-jet propulsion. Being the result of an evolution via evolutionary stone, Cloyster is rarely found in the wild, though they can be found in the sea floor, nestled among the rocks and coral, but it will actively hunt on land for Slowpoke tails. Kingler is a natural predator of Cloyster.

Gastly,92,Gastly is a Ghost/Poison type Pokémon introduced in Generation 1. It is known as the Gas Pokémon.,"Gastly has no true form, due to 95% of its body being poisonous gas. However, it consistently appears as a black, spherical Pokémon surrounded by a purple haze. It has a wide, pink mouth with two visible fangs. Though its eyes seem to extend past its round body, visible eyelids surround them. It produces a faint, sweet smell. The toxic gas surrounding the main body can induce fainting and suffocation, and it is capable of enshrouding an enemy of any size. Its gaseous form makes it one of the  lightest Pokémon tying with Haunter, Flabébé, Cosmog, and Kartana.

The anime suggests that Gastly has a playful personality, often frightening and playing pranks on people for fun. However, it has shown a willingness to preserve or pass on the memories of departed humans. It has further been shown changing form and creating illusions, and it is capable of phasing through solid objects and forming tangible hands out of its gasses. Gastly can be found in caves,  but the anime has shown it living in old, dilapidated buildings, as well. It will dwindle away when exposed to strong winds, so groups cluster under house eaves to escape the wind. It may also cause flickering lights in abandoned houses. In the past, Night Shade was its signature move.

Haunter,93,Haunter is a Ghost/Poison type Pokémon introduced in Generation 1. It is known as the Gas Pokémon.,"Haunter is a purple Pokémon with a gaseous body. It has a round head flanked by three large, spiked protrusions on either side. It has triangular eyes with small pupils and a mouth with a long, pink tongue. The gases composing its head curve into its mouth to form several pointed teeth. Disembodies hands with three clawed fingers each float in front of its body. Its body tapers into a jagged tail. Its gaseous form makes it one of the  lightest Pokémon tying with Gastly, Flabébé, Cosmog, and Kartana. It can also float through walls.

Haunter hides in very dark places, such as caves, and is afraid of light. If a human or a Pokémon comes near Haunter, it will stalk the victim while floating and beckon it to come closer. Once approached it will then lick the victim with its gaseous tongue, inflicting convulsions in the victim that last until death. Despite its predatory nature, it has been known to entertain and prank people in the anime. Additionally, it has even been shown to feel intense loyalty to a deceased Trainer. In the past, Night Shade was its signature move.

It has red eyes, a wide mouth that is usually curled into a sinister grin, and pointed ears. On its back are numerous spikes and it has smaller spikes on top of its head similar to tufty fur. Its arms and legs are short with three digits on both its hands and feet. It also has a stubby tail.

As Mega Gengar, a portion of its body sinks into the ground and its arms and tail lengthen. The lower portions turn a more reddish purple, and a third eye appears on its forehead. This new unblinking eye is oval, yellow, and allows it to see into other dimensions.[1] The spikes on Mega Gengar's back are more numerous and pointed and additional spikes appear on its hands and tail. Its ears are now considerably longer and tilt backward. Mega Gengar has the ability to access other dimensions and has a vicious nature. It may even curse its own Trainer.

Gengar has the ability to hide perfectly in the shadow of any object, granting it exceptional stealth. However, Gengar's body acts as a heat sink. Its presence cools the temperature of the surrounding area by nearly 10°F (5°C), because it absorbs the warmth. The anime has shown that Gengar can fly and possess people and other Pokémon. In the past, Night Shade was its signature move.

Gengar is very mischievous, and at times, malicious. It enjoys playing practical jokes and casting curses, such as pretending to be one's shadow, then behaving erratically. When the quarry notices, the Gengar takes delight in its victim's terror. However, Gengar has been known to be loyal to a Trainer who treats it well. Being the result of an evolution via trading, Gengar is rarely found in the wild, though they can be found in caves and dark places where shadows form. It is especially fond of urban areas such as cities and back alleys, but only during the night.

Onix,95,Onix is a Rock/Ground type Pokémon introduced in Generation 1. It is known as the Rock Snake Pokémon.,"Onix is a Pokémon composed of a giant chain of gray boulders that become smaller towards the tail. Its length makes it the tallest Rock-type Pokémon. It has black eyes and a rounded snout. On top of its head is a rocky spine. As it grows older, it becomes more rounded and smoother, eventually becoming similar to black diamonds. Inside its brain is a magnet that serves as an internal compass.

Onix tunnels under the ground at over 50 miles (80 kilometers) per hour, which causes tremors and a terrifying roar that echoes a long way. Hard objects encountered while tunneling are absorbed into its body, which makes it very sturdy. It also consumes the boulders for food. The massive, winding tunnels it leaves behind are used as homes by Diglett. As seen in the Pokémon Stadium series, Onix is capable of rotating its head, or any part of its body, in a full 360 degrees. It is a very aggressive Pokémon that will constantly attack humans and other Pokémon when in pain, as seen in the anime. Onix can be found in mountains and caves.

It has tired-looking eyes, a short trunk above its mouth, and triangular ears with brown interiors. The upper half of Drowzee's body is yellow and the lower half is brown. A wavy line separates the two halves. It has a round belly and short legs. Its feet are brown, except for its two toes, which are yellow. The bottom of each foot has a small, round, pink pad in the middle of it. There are three fingers on each of its hands. Drowzee is believed to have a common ancestor with Munna and Musharna.

Drowzee is able to put people to sleep and can then sense the person's dreams. This is so it knows what kind of dream it would be eating. It has certain preferences for the dreams it eats, and it is known to love fun dreams and become ill from bad dreams. It will rarely eat the dreams of adults, as the dreams of children are seemingly tastier. Drowzee remembers every dream it has eaten and may show past meals to a person it trusts. It eats dreams through the victim's nose, so it is said that Drowzee is standing over a person's pillow if their nose itches while they are asleep. Drowzee lives in grasslands and savannas.

Hypno,97,Hypno is a Psychic type Pokémon introduced in Generation 1. It is known as the Hypnosis Pokémon.,"Hypno is a bipedal, humanoid Pokémon that has yellow skin. It has triangular ears with brown interiors, sleepy looking eyes, and a large nose. On its neck, it has a ruff of white fur, which is longer on the female.

Hypno is able to put people to sleep by swinging its pendulum. It is known to reside away from humans and on less traveled roads. If anyone comes by, Hypno will hypnotize them and eat their dreams. It carries away people having good dreams and is even known to have stolen a child at one point. However, in the Alola region, it preys primarily on Komala. While it awaits its prey, it polishes its pendulum.

Krabby,98,Krabby is a Water type Pokémon introduced in Generation 1. It is known as the River Crab Pokémon.,"Krabby is a crustacean Pokémon with a strong outer shell protecting its small body. Its upper half is red and has its eyes and two small spikes on the top of its head. Its light tan arms are also connected to its upper body. Its lower body is light tan and doubles as its jaw with two fangs overlapping its upper body. Its hips are visible on the lower front of its body connected to its four long, thin legs. Each leg has a single, claw-like foot. The main features of Krabby's body are the two large, red pincers at the end of its arms. Krabby uses them as its main form of offense, and as a form of balance. Sometimes, Krabby may lose a claw during battle or have a damaged claw forcibly removed. However, the claw regenerates over a short period.

In the wild, Krabby lives near the edge of water in both fresh and salt water. Krabby is most commonly found on beaches where it burrows in the sand. In times of scarce food sources, it may eat sand to regain nutrients and will be very aggressive in defending its home. Its main form of defense is creating foam to shroud its body, in order to confuse opponents into thinking that it is bigger than it actually is. As seen in the anime, Krabby generally keeps to itself, but will quickly defend itself if provoked. In the past, Crabhammer was its signature move.

Kingler,99,Kingler is a Water type Pokémon introduced in Generation 1. It is known as the Pincer Pokémon.,"Kingler is a crustacean Pokémon resembling a crab. Its strong shell covers the outside of its body, featuring a red upper half and a light tan lower half. Its upper half is topped with six tall, thin spikes that resemble a crown. Its light tan arms are also connected to its upper body. Its lower half doubles as its jaw with six fangs overlapping its upper body. Its two outer fangs are much larger than the inner four and are roughly half as tall as Kingler's entire body. Its hips visibly protrude from its lower body and connect to its four long, thin legs. Each leg has a single, claw-like foot. Kingler's main feature is its red pincers. Its left claw is roughly twice as large as the other and hard as steel.

Kingler is often found on the edges of water, usually the ocean. It its powerful claws have 10,000 horsepower and are capable of prying open the shells of Shellder and Cloyster. While Kingler's large, left claw is its main tool for offensive maneuvers, it is so large and heavy that Kingler can barely lift it. It causes balancing problems and Kingler may quickly become fatigued from continuous use. However, it has been shown to communicate with other Kingler by waving its pincers around. In the past, Crabhammer was its signature move.

The top half is red, while the bottom half is white. Because of its resemblance to Poké Balls, it is thought that it was created when one was exposed to an energy pulse. This is supported by the fact that its components do not occur naturally. Voltorb is generally found in power plants and other areas with electric fields. It was first discovered in the plant where modern Poké Balls were invented. It has a volatile temperament and will explode if bumped or agitated.

For this reason, many Trainers try to pick it up, mistaking it for an item. The Pocket Monsters Carddass Trading Cards depict Electrode as hollow. Many know it by the nickname ""Bomb Ball.""

Electrode tends to live in power plants where fresh electricity is being generated, which it consumes. As a result, it often causes blackouts. The more electric energy Electrode consumes, the faster it moves. Electrode explodes in response to even the smallest stimulation, simply to entertain itself, or because it has taken in too much electricity. When full of stored electricity, it has been known to drift with the wind.

Exeggcute,102,Exeggcute is a Grass/Psychic type Pokémon introduced in Generation 1. It is known as the Egg Pokémon.,"Exeggcute is a Pokémon resembling six light pink eggs, usually seen arranged with five heads huddled around a sixth. Each ""head"" has a slightly different facial expression, but each face has triangular eyes with tiny black pupils and a small mouth. Each shell has some cracks, and one member of the bundle usually has its yellow insides or brain exposed. More numerous cracks are a sign that it is close to evolution. Despite looking like eggs, Exeggcute is actually more closely related to plant seeds. It is believed to carry genes of plants and other species.

Exeggcute gathers in swarms of six. The heads communicate with each other by using a form of telepathy that only they can understand. Should the number of Exeggcute be reduced to less than six, the remaining Exeggcute will attempt to replace it with a similarly sized Pokémon as seen in the anime. Pidgeotto and Crabrawler are its natural predators, which it chases off with psychokinesis. Exeggcute inhabits jungles and forests. In the Alola region, it tends to be heavier. This is due to the shells being packed full.

Exeggcute and its evolved form, Exeggutor, are the only known Pokémon that can learn Barrage.

Exeggutor,103,Exeggutor is a Grass/Psychic type Pokémon introduced in Generation 1. It is known as the Coconut Pokémon.,"Exeggutor is a tall, bipedal Pokémon that resembles a palm tree. Its body and legs are light brown with thin black rings and its legs are thick with two-toed feet. There light yellow paw pad on each foot's underside. It has thin, green leaves sprouting from the top of its body. Exeggutor has three to six round, light yellow heads that resemble coconuts, each with differing facial expressions.

Each head thinks independently of the others, so it makes a lot of noise as each head speaks its mind. If all the heads want to go in a different direction, its body is unable to move. They are able to communicate telepathically as well and sometimes use it to come to a joint decision. It uses psychic powers to fight, and since all three heads are capable its power is tripled. If one of these heads grows too large, it falls off and groups back together to become an Exeggcute. In the anime, Exeggutor also has been seen in groups of its own kind, meaning that it is not a solitary Pokémon. Being the result of an evolution via evolutionary stone, Exeggutor is rarely found in the wild, though they can be found in forests and jungles.

Due to the abundance of sunlight in the Alola region, Exeggutor grows over five times taller than in other regions. Its neck is thinner and much longer, causing it to more resemble a palm tree. This variant of Exeggutor has a long, tapering tail with two leaves, and a fourth light green head on the tip. This extra head can act on its own and defend the rear. [1] Its long neck can be used like a whip to attack enemies with its hard head. However, its neck can also be a weak point as it will become dizzy swinging it around. Its increased height reduced its need for a psychic defense and has instead awakened draconic powers. The people of Alola claim that Alolan Exeggutor is this Pokémon's true form. Ancient carvings and murals depict this Pokémon. Its extra height makes it the tallest Grass-type and Dragon-type, as well as the heaviest Grass-type.

Exeggutor and its pre-evolved form are the only known Pokémon that can learn Barrage. Alolan Exeggutor is also the only known Pokémon that can learn Dragon Hammer.

Cubone,104,Cubone is a Ground type Pokémon introduced in Generation 1. It is known as the Lonely Pokémon.,"Cubone is a small, bipedal Pokémon with a light brown hide that covers most of its body, except for its cream-colored belly. Two small claws, one on each hand, serve as its thumbs, and one large nail on each foot make up its toes. It has two small spikes on its back and a short tail. On its head, Cubone wears the skull of its dead mother as a helmet. Because of this, much of its actual face has never been seen, except for its triangular, black eyes and a small area surrounding them. The skull has two rounded horns on the top of its head and a tooth-like point on the lower sides. Under the skull, Cubone has a brown snout. The small Cubone survives only through the immense skill it possesses in wielding the bone it carries as a weapon. The bone allows it to learn Bone Club and Bonemerang, two moves exclusive to Cubone and its evolution Marowak. It and its evolution are also the only Pokémon capable of using the Thick Club item.

It is called the Lonely Pokémon because of its tendency to keep to itself and avoid social situations, due to the trauma caused by the death of its mother. Cubone will often weep at night in mourning of its mother. When Cubone cries, the skull that it wears on its head vibrates and emits ""a plaintive and mournful sound."" On the night of a full moon, the cries are said to be especially terrible. Cubone seems to recognize its mother in the moon, and so it howls with a particular sadness. Its cries attract Mandibuzz, a natural predator. Cubone lives in rocky areas, usually on mountains or in caves. It also once inhabited the Pokémon Tower in Lavender Town where deceased Pokémon were buried and mourned.

Marowak,105,Marowak is a Ground type Pokémon introduced in Generation 1. It is known as the Bone Keeper Pokémon.,"Marowak is a bipedal Pokémon with light brown skin and a cream-colored underside. Two small claws, one on each hand, serve as its thumbs, and one large nail on each foot make up its toes. It has a short tail with a small spike near the tip. Marowak's head is composed of the skull it once wore as a mask. It can no longer remove the skull, which has become part of its body. The skull has two pointed spikes on the back similar to ears and tiny nostrils on the tip of the snout. Marowak's triangular, brown eyes are also located in the skull. Marowak is well known for ferocity with its bone club, which it is said to collect from a hidden graveyard. It and its pre-evolution, Cubone, are the only known Pokémon that can learn Bone Club and Bonemerang and the only Pokémon capable of using the Thick Club item.

Upon evolution, Marowak has overcome the grief of its mother's passing. Now ferocious and violent, Marowak is an adept combatant that uses the bone it carries as a weapon and a boomerang. Having evolved, it seeks vengeance on its natural enemy Mandibuzz, which prey on Cubone because of its naturally weak and timid demeanor. Marowak has also been recorded pounding on boulders with the bone club it carries in order to tap out messages to others. It lives in mountains to test its skills.

In the Alola region, Marowak was faced with an abundance of its natural enemies, Grass-type Pokémon. This harsh environment led it to bond closely with its friends, which is said to have created a sort of sixth sense and caused it to take a new form. Alolan Marowak's body is black and it has pale grey eyes. There is dark, flamelike mark on its skull between the eyes. Compared to regular Marowak's squatter, thicker body, Alolan Marowak is relatively thin. White markings resembling shoulder blades, vertebrae, and hip bones are visible on its back. The bone Alolan Marowak uses is longer than the one regular Marowak uses. It customarily mourns its companions by burying them and dance in mourning.

Alolan Marowak rubs the bone it wields against its forehead to light the ends in a green flame, and then twirls the flaming bone. It specializes in an attack where it releases a weak ball of flame from its bone that will relentlessly pursue its foe. Alolans would fear it for a conjurer, due to its rarity and the fearful sight of it dancing with its bone.[1] Once its flames have spread onto an opponent, they are impossible to put out with water. Alolan Marowak is the only known Pokémon that can learn Shadow Bone.

The bone Alolan Marowak uses is longer than the one regular Marowak uses. It customarily mourns its companions by burying them and dance in mourning.

Alolan Marowak rubs the bone it wields against its forehead to light the ends in a green flame, and then twirls the flaming bone. It specializes in an attack where it releases a weak ball of flame from its bone that will relentlessly pursue its foe. Alolans would fear it for a conjurer, due to its rarity and the fearful sight of it dancing with its bone.[1] Once its flames have spread onto an opponent, they are impossible to put out with water. Alolan Marowak is the only known Pokémon that can learn Shadow Bone.

Hitmonlee,106,Hitmonlee is a Fighting type Pokémon introduced in Generation 1. It is known as the Kicking Pokémon.,"Hitmonlee is a humanoid Pokémon with an ovoid body. Lacking a distinct neck and head, its upper torso has almond-shaped eyes with black space around them and appears to lack a nose and mouth. Primarily brown, it has cream-colored, segmented arms and legs. Each hand has three fingers and each foot has three clawed toes. The soles of its feet and its ankles have circular, yellow pads. Hitmonlee is an exclusively male species with no female counterpart.

Hitmonlee's legs freely contract and stretch similar to a coiled spring. This flexibility allows Hitmonlee to run with lengthy strides and gives it greater reach for its kicks. Its excellent sense of balance enables it to kick in succession from any position. After battling, it rubs down its legs to relax the tight muscles. Rare in the wild, it is primarily found in urban areas. It had a number of kicking moves as signature moves in the past: Jump Kick, High Jump Kick, Rolling Kick,  and Mega Kick.

It is known as the Punching Pokémon.,"Hitmonchan is a tan, humanoid Pokémon that is exclusively male with no female counterpart. There are five blunt protrusions on top of its head, and it has structures resembling pads over its shoulders. It appears to be wearing a light purple tunic and kilt, as well as red boxing gloves and light purple boxing shoes. In-between the tunic and kilt is a small, black area. As this appearance suggests, Hitmonchan specializes in punching. It is able to throw punches too quick to be seen with the naked eye. By punching with a corkscrew motion, it is even capable of drilling through concrete. However, Hitmonchan requires a break every three minutes while fighting. Despite the need for frequent breaks, it has an unwavering spirit and will never give up in a difficult situation. In the past, it claimed Mach Punch and Vacuum Wave as signature moves. Usually found in urban areas, it is rarely seen in the wild.

Lickitung,108,Lickitung is a Normal type Pokémon introduced in Generation 1. It is known as the Licking Pokémon.,"Lickitung is a bipedal Pokémon with a round body and a thick, powerful tail. It has soft, pink skin with curved yellow lines on its belly and a yellow ring marking on each knee. It has a thumb-like claw on each hand and a single large nail on each foot. There is a yellow spot on its palms and the soles of its feet. It has beady eyes and a long, prehensile tongue. The tongue is likely connected to its tail, which twitches when the tongue is pulled.

At over 6 feet 6 inches (2 meters), Lickitung's tongue is twice as long as its body. Sticky, smelly saliva coats its tongue, which causes a tingling sensation when touched and can cause rashes if not cleaned off. It is used for capturing prey, exploring its environment and cleaning. However, it is questionable if its saliva is clean in the first place as whatever it cleans has a lingering smell. Lickitung remembers things by their texture and taste, although it apparently dislikes sour things. The tongue is both dexterous and powerful enough to lift people, as seen in the anime. Lickitung can be found in grassy plains and meadows.

Koffing,109,Koffing is a Poison type Pokémon introduced in Generation 1. It is known as the Poison Gas Pokémon.,"Koffing is a spherical Pokémon filled with toxic gases. It has vacant eyes and a wide mouth that usually has two pointed teeth in the upper jaw. However, a full set of teeth has been seen in the anime. Below its face is a cream-colored skull-and-crossbones marking. Several geyser-like protrusions, which usually release a mustard-colored gas, cover this Pokémon's body. Its purple skin is very thin, and over inflation can cause it to explode.

Koffing creates gases within its body by mixing toxins with garbage, and produces more gas in higher temperatures. These gases are malodorous and cause sniffles, coughs, and teary eyes to those around it. The gases are also lighter than air, allowing Koffing to hover. When agitated, it creates a more toxic gas and expels it through the holes in its body. As shown in the anime, Koffing's gas can be ignited by fire or electricity. Koffing is most often found in urban areas.

Weezing,110,Weezing is a Poison type Pokémon introduced in Generation 1. It is known as the Poison Gas Pokémon.,"Weezing is a purple Pokémon consisting of two spherical heads connected by a thin tube with another sphere in the center. The heads have differing sizes and features. The left head is larger and has prominent eyebrows, pointed teeth protruding from its lower jaw, and two flat teeth in its upper jaw. The smaller, right head simply has two pointed teeth, one at each corner of its mouth. The larger head has a cream-colored skull-and-crossbones marking below its face, while the smaller head has a ring marking instead. It is covered with many geyser-like protrusions, which usually expel mustard-colored gases. Weezing is said to form when poisonous gases pool and two Koffing fuse over many years. Very rarely, two Koffing can become a Weezing in a short timespan because of a sudden mutation. Triplet Weezing have been discovered, although they are extremely rare.

Each of Weezing's heads contains a different toxin. It mixes its gases by inflating one head and deflating the other. When its gases mix, Weezing becomes more toxic and putrid. Weezing can hover in midair, presumably due to gases lighter than air, as is the case for Koffing. Despite their stench and poison, Weezing's gases can be used to make top-grade perfume by diluting them to the highest level.

Weezing lives in urban areas. It seeks a dirty, unkempt house and nests there. At night, when the people in the house are asleep, it will go through the trash. Weezing feeds on the dust, microorganisms, and especially gases emitted by garbage and toxic waste. Weezing's body expands and smells worse upon inhaling poisonous gases.

Rhyhorn,111,Rhyhorn is a Ground/Rock type Pokémon introduced in Generation 1. It is known as the Spikes Pokémon.,"Rhyhorn is a rhinoceros-like Pokémon with a body covered in gray, rocky plates. Its underside and rear are smooth, and it has four short legs with two claws on each foot. It has a triangular head with narrow, red eyes, two fangs protruding from its upper jaw, small, triangular openings on the upper sides, and a short horn on the tip of its snout. A female will have a shorter horn than a male. A spiked ridge runs along its back. In addition to its rocky hide, its bones are a thousand times harder than human bones.

Rhyhorn's brain is very small, giving it a one-track mind. When it runs, it forgets why it started and continues until it falls asleep. However, it may recall the reason upon demolishing something. Due to its short legs, it is inept at turning and can only run in straight lines. It does not care if obstacles get in the way, merely smashing through them or sending them flying. However, it may feel pain the day after a collision. Rhyhorn lives in rough terrain.

Rhydon,112,Rhydon is a Ground/Rock type Pokémon introduced in Generation 1. It is known as the Drill Pokémon.,"Rhydon is a large, gray, bipedal Pokémon with features similar to both dinosaurs and rhinoceroses. It has narrow, red eyes and two fangs in its upper jaw. On the tip of its snout is a cream-colored horn, which is smaller on a female than a male. There are several other spikes and projections on its head: on top is spike that curves forward, two triangular points resembling ears on the sides, a wide, wavy crest under each ear, and spiky ridges on each cheek. It has a cream-colored abdomen divided into strips by thin divots. A rocky plate on its chest slightly overlaps its abdomen. There is a row of spikes down its back, and has a long tail with thin, black stripes.

Rhydon is a physically powerful Pokémon. It is recorded as being able to topple buildings with a sweeping blow of its tail, and its horn is able to bore through solid rock and shatter diamonds. Its armor-like hide protects it from heat and physical blows. It is stated to be capable of passing unscathed through streams of magma and withstanding a direct blow from a cannonball without being harmed. However, because of this tough hide, it is insensitive. Despite its well-developed brain, it can be forgetful. Rhydon lives in rough terrain.

A kindhearted Pokémon, Chansey will share its eggs with injured people and Pokémon. This is the basis for its signature move, Soft-Boiled. The eggs become more delicious if Chansey is raised with love and care. Due to its egg being overharvested, Chansey is extremely rare in the wild and is said to bring good luck and happiness to those who manage to catch it. Fleeing from those seeking its egg has made it a fast runner. It is more commonly found in urban settings. Chansey is the only Pokémon capable of using the Lucky Punch item.

Tangela,114,Tangela is a Grass type Pokémon introduced in Generation 1. It is known as the Vine Pokémon.,"Tangela is a Pokémon covered by blue, seaweed-like vines that obscure its face. There is a small opening in the vines that reveals its eyes surrounded by a black space. The vines give Tangela a round shape, but it is unknown what it looks like without them. Its vines are covered in fine hair and are always growing. If damaged or lost, replacements are grown. There is a pair of red boot-like feet poking out from under the vines, but no visible arms.

Tangela can ensnare and entangle anything that moves too close to it with its vines. The vines constantly jiggle and sway, unnerving enemies and causing a tickling sensation if ensnared. Tangela's vines will snap off easily and painlessly if the target pulls on them, so it can quickly escape. Tangela can usually be found in temperate grasslands.

Kangaskhan,115,Kangaskhan is a Normal type Pokémon introduced in Generation 1. It is known as the Parent Pokémon.,"Kangaskhan is a large, bipedal Pokémon that vaguely resembles a kangaroo. It has a brown hide with several raised patches and a cream-colored belly. It has large, cream-colored ears, narrow, red eyes, and a short, rounded snout with two fangs in the back of its upper jaw. On top of its head is a thick, black plate. There are epaulette-like growths over its shoulders and a row of spikes down its back. It has three clawed digits on each hand and foot and a thick tail. On is belly is a pouch that contains a baby Kangaskhan. Unlike its parent, the baby is light purple and has smooth skin. Kangaskhan is a female-only species with no male counterpart.

As Mega Kangaskhan, the mother Kangaskhan appears unchanged. However, the baby temporarily grows and gains some new features. There are now raised patches on its knees similar to those seen on its mother. These patches also appear aligned horizontally along its waist with a larger patch on its belly. Small, spiked growths appear underneath its ears. The child is feisty, hates to lose and will boldly challenge its opponents to protect its mother.[1] The mother's happiness over its child's growth is the source of its additional strength. However, it feels uneasy about the child's future, as it is only skilled at fighting and nothing else. It is also saddened by the reminder that its child will one day leave.

Kangaskhan is a nurturing Pokémon that protects its young at all costs. The baby leaves the pouch only rarely until it is three years old. In order to avoid crushing the baby, Kangaskhan sleeps standing up. If the mother feels the environment is safe, it will allow its young out to play. However, it will violently attack anything that it sees as a threat to its young. Regardless of how badly injured it becomes, the mother will not cease fighting until its young is safe.

Mega Kangaskhan,115,Kangaskhan is a Normal type Pokémon introduced in Generation 1. It is known as the Parent Pokémon.,"Kangaskhan is a large, bipedal Pokémon that vaguely resembles a kangaroo. It has a brown hide with several raised patches and a cream-colored belly. It has large, cream-colored ears, narrow, red eyes, and a short, rounded snout with two fangs in the back of its upper jaw. On top of its head is a thick, black plate. There are epaulette-like growths over its shoulders and a row of spikes down its back. It has three clawed digits on each hand and foot and a thick tail. On is belly is a pouch that contains a baby Kangaskhan. Unlike its parent, the baby is light purple and has smooth skin. Kangaskhan is a female-only species with no male counterpart.

As Mega Kangaskhan, the mother Kangaskhan appears unchanged. However, the baby temporarily grows and gains some new features. There are now raised patches on its knees similar to those seen on its mother. These patches also appear aligned horizontally along its waist with a larger patch on its belly. Small, spiked growths appear underneath its ears. The child is feisty, hates to lose and will boldly challenge its opponents to protect its mother.[1] The mother's happiness over its child's growth is the source of its additional strength. However, it feels uneasy about the child's future, as it is only skilled at fighting and nothing else. It is also saddened by the reminder that its child will one day leave.

Kangaskhan is a nurturing Pokémon that protects its young at all costs. The baby leaves the pouch only rarely until it is three years old. In order to avoid crushing the baby, Kangaskhan sleeps standing up. If the mother feels the environment is safe, it will allow its young out to play. However, it will violently attack anything that it sees as a threat to its young. Regardless of how badly injured it becomes, the mother will not cease fighting until its young is safe. Although it was nearly hunted to extinction, Kangaskhan can be found in savannahs and other grasslands. In the past, Dizzy Punch was its signature move.

Horsea,116,Horsea is a Water type Pokémon introduced in Generation 1. It is known as the Dragon Pokémon.,"Horsea is a light blue, seahorse-like Pokémon. It has red eyes, a long, tubular mouth, and three spike-like fins on either side of its head. Its ridged belly and single dorsal fin are cream-colored. Highly adept in the water, it uses its dorsal fin to swim in any direction while facing forward. It has tightly curled tail that it can use as both a balance and an anchor when caught in a strong current. In safer environments, it uses its tail to play with other members of its species.

Horsea feeds on insects and moss gathered from rocks. If Horsea senses danger, it sprays water or dense black ink from its mouth at its attacker. It can shoot more precisely at insects flying above the surface of the water. Horsea nests in coral reefs and islands throughout the ocean. Many Eggs are laid every year, and the young are raised by the male Horsea rather than the female.

Seadra,117,Seadra is a Water type Pokémon introduced in Generation 1. It is known as the Dragon Pokémon.,"Seadra is a light blue, seahorse-like Pokémon with a cream-colored belly covered in rough scales. It has a long, tubular mouth, narrow, black eyes, a fin-like ridge above each eye, and spiny pectoral fins. It also has a large, coiled tail. It has a pair of dorsal fins with sharp, cream-colored tips that exude venom. Seadra's venom is toxic enough to induce fainting in humans, but is prized among practitioners of traditional medicine.

Seadra can swim in any direction while facing forward by rapidly flapping its fins and tail. It catches its prey by spinning its body to create large whirlpools. When its prey is exhausted, Seadra swallows it whole using its long snout. Seadra makes its nest by either wriggling between or anchoring itself to branches of coral under the ocean. After a female Seadra gives birth, the male Seadra will take care of the young. It is markedly vicious and will mercilessly attack those who venture near its nest.

Goldeen,118,Goldeen is a Water type Pokémon introduced in Generation 1. It is known as the Goldfish Pokémon.,"Goldeen is a white, fish-like Pokémon with orange markings. It has circular blue eyes with orange lids and prominent pink lips. On its forehead is a large horn, which is larger on a male than on a female. It has a small, wavy dorsal fin surrounded by an orange patch and long pectoral fins with orange markings at the bases. Goldeen's billowing tail fin is orange around the base and turns white toward the edges. Its tail is admired by many for its beauty and similarity to a ballroom dress.

Goldeen has a wild temperament and will use its horn to smash its way to freedom if kept in an aquarium. It competes with others of its kind to determine which has the strongest, thickest horn. Humans swimming near it must exercise caution lest Goldeen ram them. Goldeen is a very common sight in any body of fresh water, including ponds, lakes, and rivers. It can be seen swimming upstream in large schools during the breeding season in spring. Its strong fins allow it to maintain a steady speed of five knots while swimming upstream. In the past, Waterfall was its signature move.

Seaking,119,Seaking is a Water type Pokémon introduced in Generation 1. It is known as the Goldfish Pokémon.,"Seaking is a primarily orange and white, fish-like Pokémon. It has round, dark eyes, prominent pink lips, two small fangs, and a cream-colored horn in the center of its forehead. A female will have a smaller horn than a male. Most of its body is orange with a patch of white under its mouth and along its underside. There are several black markings on its body: two thick lines under each eye, a large wavy patch on its back, and several speckles near its tail. It has billowing pectoral fins and a pair of tail fins shaped like butterfly wings, all of which are white specked with black. However, its dorsal fin is pure white and rigid.

Seaking is a very powerful swimmer that is found in rivers and streams. It can swim not only against a river's current, but up waterfalls as well. In the autumn spawning season, it grows fatter and more vibrant. It travels upriver where male Seaking engage in elaborate dances to court females. Seaking uses its powerful horn to bore holes in riverbed boulders in order to shelter its Eggs from water currents. A mated pair take turns patrolling around their new nest for roughly a month and defend it with their lives. In the past, Waterfall was its signature move.

Staryu,120,Staryu is a Water type Pokémon introduced in Generation 1. It is known as the Star Shape Pokémon.,"Staryu is a golden-brown starfish-like Pokémon with five appendages. These appendages surround an exterior organ called the core. The core resembles a golden metal casing with a red gem in the center, which is held in place by a golden ring looped around Staryu's lower left point. If any of Staryu's appendages are lost or eaten by predators like Lumineon, it is unharmed and can grow them back with ease provided the core is still intact.

When the sun goes down, the core glows its brightest. Many Staryu will float from the seafloor to the surface and align themselves with stars of the night sky as their core flickers, displaying a connection with the celestial bodies of space. The anime has shown that if Staryu becomes weak, its core will grow faint and flash slowly. Staryu can be found at the very bottom of the ocean on the seafloors. There are times, however, when Staryu finds itself in rivers that lead into the ocean as seen in Pokémon Snap. In the past, Camouflage was its signature move.

Starmie,121,Starmie is a Water/Psychic type Pokémon introduced in Generation 1. It is known as the Mysterious Pokémon.,"Starmie is a Pokémon  that resembles two violet starfish with five appendages each. The front starfish has a golden formation in the center. In the center of the golden casing is its red jewel core, which can glow in seven colors and has developed to resemble a cut precious stone. The second starfish is semi-attached to the back of the first and can spin 360 degrees. This rotational action is how Starmie swims through the ocean. It can also launch itself out of the water and fly through the air for short periods, as seen in Pokémon Snap.

From its core, Starmie can emit electrical waves that are powerful enough to reach the furthest parts of the universe. The multi-color glowing of its core is also believed to be a method of communication inside the species. As seen in the anime, the core will go dark if Starmie is knocked unconscious and will sometimes flicker if Starmie is low on health. Because of its body shape and habit of sending transmissions skyward, some people believe this Pokémon to be extraterrestrial. Being the result of an evolution via evolutionary stone, Starmie is rarely seen in the wild, but it can be found in the deepest parts of the ocean. It is Lumineon's favorite food.

Mr. Mime,122,Mr. Mime is a Psychic/Fairy type Pokémon introduced in Generation 1. It is known as the Barrier Pokémon.,"Mr. Mime is a bipedal, humanoid Pokémon. Blue growths resembling clown hair extend from the sides of its pale pink head, and there is a magenta circle on each cheek. Its jaw is curved inward, resembling the mouth of a wooden dummy. It has a round, white body with a magenta spot in the middle, light pink arms and legs that connect to its body via magenta spheres, and small white coverings over its knees. Its white hands resemble gloves with magenta pads on the tips of its white fingers and its dark blue feet curl upward at the tips.

From birth, this Pokémon is an excellent pantomime. As it matures, it gains the ability to solidify air molecules by vibrating its fingertips. This ability allows it to create invisible objects with its gestures. It punishes those who interrupt its act or are not impressed by slapping them. Mr. Mime is usually very rare, but can be found in suburban areas. In the past, Substitute was its signature move.

Scyther,123,Scyther is a Bug/Flying type Pokémon introduced in Generation 1. It is known as the Mantis Pokémon.,"Scyther is a bipedal, insectoid Pokémon. It is primarily green with thin, cream-colored sections between its head, thorax, and abdomen. The abdomen of a female will be slightly larger than that of a male. It has narrow eyes and three points on the back of its somewhat reptilian head. Its forearms consist of large, white scythes, which it uses for hunting as well as fighting. On its thighs are spikes of fur, and it has three clawed toes on its large feet. Two pairs of cream-colored wings extend from its back. While these wings do allow Scyther to fly, it rarely does so.

Scyther is an adept hunter that tears at its prey with its scythes. Its green coloration gives in excellent camouflage in the grass, and its quick movement is too fast to follow and increases the effectiveness of its scythes. By cutting through hard objects, it keeps its arms sharp. The anime has shown that wild Scyther form swarms. A new leader is elected when the current leader is defeated in a fight against a challenger; the former leader then leaves the swarm and goes into exile as a result. It has also been shown that Scyther becomes aggressive when faced with the color red. Although it is rare, Scyther can be found in grasslands.

Jynx,124,Jynx is an Ice/Psychic type Pokémon introduced in Generation 1. It is known as the Human Shape Pokémon.,"Jynx is a bipedal, humanoid Pokémon that resembles a woman. It has a purple face, pink lips, saucer-like eyes, and long blonde hair. It wears a red gown with two gold circlets on the chest. While the anime has shown it to possess feet, the 3D games show only blackness under the dress and it lacks a footprint. It has white arms and five-fingered purple hands. Originally, its face was colored black and Pokémon Stadium’s fainting animation had it disappear leaving only its hair behind. This implies the dark skin is intended to be simply darkness or nothingness. Jynx is a female-only species with no male counterpart.

Jynx has a language that sounds similar to human speech and includes several cry patterns. However, this language has yet to be deciphered. It prefers to communicate by using dance-like movements. These rhythmic movements often cause people to dance along with it. It puts its enemies to sleep using its signature move, Lovely Kiss. Jynx often is found in urban areas.

Electabuzz,125,Electabuzz is an Electric type Pokémon introduced in Generation 1. It is known as the Electric Pokémon.,"Electabuzz is a slightly humanoid Pokémon with a few feline traits. It has antennae with bulbous tips where its ears should be, two long tufts of fur on top of its head, small eyes, and two large fangs in its upper jaw. It is covered in yellow fur with many black stripes. There is a large, lightning bolt-shaped stripe on its chest, a V-shaped stripe on its forehead, one stripe on its side, a thick stripe down its back, two bands on each leg, several broken bands on each arm, and many rings around its long tail. There are three clawed toes on each of its feet, two in front and one in back, and five fingers on each hand.

In the dark, Electabuzz will glow light blue from the electrical charges running across its body. It is constantly leaking more electricity than it consumes. During torrential thunderstorms, Electabuzz will compete to find locations likely to be struck by lightning in order to absorb the electric power. Electabuzz is often used as an alternative to lightning rods because it is unharmed by the absorption of electricity. It is also capable of entirely nonverbal communication via electrical currents when in close proximity to another of its species.

As demonstrated in the anime, Electabuzz is sent into a rage by the color red. In battle, Electabuzz windmills its arms, apparently to add momentum to its punches. This method of battle seems ineffective, as opponents can escape in the meantime. Electabuzz typically resides near power plants and can cause blackouts in cities, though it can also be found in grasslands.

Magmar,126,Magmar is a Fire type Pokémon introduced in Generation 1. It is known as the Spitfire Pokémon.,"Magmar is a bipedal Pokémon that has a red body with yellow flame designs along the bottom half. It has a puckered, yellow beak, small eyes, and two lumps on its forehead with a yellow flame on top of each one. Rigid, red scale cover its arms and it has five, clawed fingers on each hand. Its shoulders and thighs are yellow, and its red feet have two, clawed toes each. It has black, metal shackles around its neck and ankles. Down its back is a row of red spikes, and there is a flame at the tip of its tapering, yellow tail.

Magmar's body temperature is nearly 2,200° Fahrenheit (1,200° Celsius), giving its body an orange glow. Because it hates cold places, this Pokémon typically resides in and around active volcanoes. This Pokémon has even been known to spit scorching flames to establish an ideally warm environment for itself.

In battle, Magmar blows out intense flames from all over its body as to intimidate its foes and incinerate its surroundings. The anime has shown that extremely well trained Magmar can block Electric-type attacks with super-heated air. However, an outmatched Magmar will quickly retreat, using its fiery camouflage and its wavering, rippling glare to blend into any present fires. It is able to heal its wounds and weariness by soaking in lava.

Pinsir,127,Pinsir is a Bug type Pokémon introduced in Generation 1. It is known as the Stag Beetle Pokémon.,"Pinsir is a bipedal, insectoid Pokémon with a wide, dull brown body divided into segments by thin lines. On top of its head is a large pair of gray, spiky pincers on top of its head. In its mouth are many long, flat teeth arranged horizontally and it has triangular eyes. Its legs are short and thick, while its arms are long and thin. It has three claws on each hand and foot; two of its toes face forward and one backward.

Pinsir can use its pincers to crush, toss, bludgeon, or tear opponents, lift things twice its weight, and shatter logs. Captured prey is kept in place by the piercing thorns and sheer strength of Pinsir's horns and will not be released until they are torn in half. In addition to hunting prey, the anime has shown that it enjoys tree sap. Pinsir lives deep in the temperate forests and jungles, where it burrows underground or hides in the treetops on nights cold enough to render it immobile. In Alola, it has a rivalry with Vikavolt and gets along with Heracross.

As Mega Pinsir, it gains a large pair of clear, yellow wings with an area of orange venation near the base. Additionally, a set of brown wing coverings appear. Slicing through each wing cover is a pair of orange blades. Its arms become longer and it has a T-shaped spike on each forearm. The pincers on its head are now longer with larger spikes, and its eyes are now yellow. When it Mega Evolves, Pinsir is left in a constant state of excitement. Mega Pinsir can travel up to approximately 30 mph (50 km/h) and uses its two large horns to pierce its enemies before shredding them.

Tauros,128,Tauros is a Normal type Pokémon introduced in Generation 1. It is known as the Wild Bull Pokémon.,"Tauros is a quadruped, bovine Pokémon. It is covered in light brown fur with a thick, darker brown mane around the neck. It has a rounded muzzle with a dark brown nose, small, triangular eyes, three gray bumps running vertically down its forehead, and a pair of curved, gray horns grows from atop its head. Each of its three black tails has a tuft of fur on the end, and there is a single gray hoof on each foot. Tauros is a male-only species with no female counterpart.

Tauros is a violent, rowdy Pokémon that whips itself into a frenzy using its three tails. Once it starts charging, it is unable to stop or change course until it hits something. It lives and travels in herds on plains and grasslands. It will lock horns with others of its kind, and the herd's protector takes pride in its battle-scarred horns. While still ferocious, Tauros are calmer in Alola than elsewhere, likely due to the region's climate. The practice of riding Tauros is believed to have started in Alola.

Magikarp,129,Magikarp is a Water type Pokémon introduced in Generation 1. It is known as the Fish Pokémon.,"Magikarp is a fish Pokémon with large, heavy reddish-orange scales. It has large, vacant eyes and pink lips. Its pectoral and tail fins are white. On its back is stiff, three-peaked yellow fin; there is an identical fin on its underside. It also has long barbels. The barbels are white on a female and tan on a male. A long-lived Magikarp is able to utilize its immense splashing power to leap high enough to scale mountains. It also has a strong enough immune system to survive in the most polluted of waters. However, it is usually overlooked by Trainers because of its perceived weakness: even in the heat of battle it will do nothing but flop around. It is believed that the ancestors of Magikarp were actually much stronger than modern Magikarp, and this led scientists to research this species.

Magikarp is found in many bodies of water, such as lakes, rivers, and ponds. However, due to its weak swimming ability it usually lives downstream of the water's flow. It is normally seen using its former signature move, Splash, to leap out of the water, which makes it an easy target for predators such as Pidgeotto and Pidgeot.

It is mostly blue with a yellow underbelly and a row of yellow spots down each side. Its mouth is very large and gaping, bearing four pointed teeth and yellow lips. It has one barbel and a small white fin on each side of its face. The barbels are white on a female and tan on a male. It has small, red eyes, a three-pointed, dark blue crest on its head, and four white, spiky dorsal fins. Gyarados's tail fin is similar in structure to the crest on its head, except with a thin, white fin spread between the points.

The process of evolution causes a change in its brain structure that is believed to cause its violent nature. Gyarados's fangs can crush stones and its scales are harder than steel. Gyarados is feared for its fierce temper and wanton destructive tendencies. It appears in times of conflict and destroys the surrounding area. Its rampages have been known to last a month at a time. Gyarados lives in both fresh and salty waters. Both Gyarados and its Mega form have demonstrated in the anime that it can leap huge distances both from the water and from the ground, usually several times its own body length.

When it Mega Evolves, Gyarados becomes bulkier. The fins on its cheeks become longer and gain a yellow tint. Its crest is larger and black, and its barbels also gain considerable length. A large spike extends downward underneath its chin, and it now has a black underside with a red stripe around the edges. The yellow spots along its body are replaced by raised red scales, which propel Mega Gyarados through the water. Two large yellow fins with blue spines appear on its back. Most of the other fins along its back disappear, replaced by two rows of blue spikes. There are now four yellowish, spiky fins near is tail: two on its back and two on its underside. While its brain has a powerful destructive instinct, it will obey a Trainer it truly trusts. Mega Gyarados is tied with Hoopa Unbound as the tallest Dark-type.

The foremost flippers are larger than the hind. On its back is a heavy, gray shell covered in blunt knobs.

Lapras is a gentle, helpful Pokémon that enjoys ferrying people across bodies of water. In the past, its docility made it an easy target for hunters, and it was driven to near-extinction. Recent protection efforts have seen Lapras become overabundant instead, which is now affecting the fish Pokémon numbers in some areas. An intelligent Pokémon, it is able to understand human speech. Lapras have been known to travel in large pods across the seas, spanning both polar and tropical areas. To keep in touch with other of its kind, it sings enchanting melodies. In the anime it was shown that Lapras is able to develop psychic abilities such as telepathy.

It also appears to have two pseudopods protruding from its body that it uses as arms. It is capable of transforming into an exact replica of any physical object, including its form and abilities. However, if Ditto tries to transform into something based on memory, it may get some of the details wrong.

Each Ditto has its own strengths and weaknesses when it comes to transforming. The anime and the TCG have shown that occasionally Ditto cannot change its face. It will also be unable to remain in a transformed state if it starts laughing. While its transformation ability allows it to get along with almost anything, it does not get along with its own kind. When two Ditto meet in the wild, they will attempt to transform into each other. It transforms into a rock when sleeping to avoid attack. Ditto is never far from civilization or people.

This high temperature is caused by its internal flame sac. Flareon stores and heats inhaled air in this sac, and then exhales it as fire. It is an omnivore that roasts either Berries or prey before consumption. Flareon is mostly found in populated areas and is rarely seen in the wilderness.

Porygon,137,Porygon is a Normal type Pokémon introduced in Generation 1. It is known as the Virtual Pokémon.,"Porygon is a Pokémon made completely out of programming code. It has a pink polyhedral body with a blue front, blue triangular prism feet, and a blue rectangular prism tail. It has a pink, polyhedral head that ends in a blue beak and has hexagonal eyes. In 3D games, such as Pokémon Stadium, it can detach its limbs and head from its torso. According to its Pokédex entries, it has copy protection built into its code, preventing duplication through electronic means. It was created 20 years ago at the Pokémon Lab on Cinnabar Island using the latest technology of its time, so many of its parts have since become obsolete.

Due to its man-made origins, Porygon does not need to breathe or eat, though it can still accept food if given. It has the ability to convert its body into digital data, allowing it to travel through cyberspace. Porygon has two signature moves, Conversion and Conversion 2, and in the past it also had Sharpen for a signature move. It can use Conversion to change its appearance to mimic another Pokémon's and has also demonstrated the ability to change color for camouflage. Because it is man-made, it is generally found in computers or in labs and other buildings where people work.

Omanyte,138,Omanyte is a Rock/Water type Pokémon introduced in Generation 1. It is known as the Spiral Pokémon.,"Omanyte is a small Pokémon similar to an ammonite. It has a sky blue body with ten tentacles and a pale yellow, helix-spiraled shell on its back. The shell's rim has two circular indents where Omanyte's large saucer-like eyes protrude. If attacked or threatened, it quickly withdraws into its hard shell.

Omanyte is considered extinct, although it can be revived from Fossils. Its fossils have been excavated in areas that were once oceans long ago. Omanyte regulated its buoyancy by storing and releasing air within its shell and controlled direction by twisting its tentacles. While Omanyte fed on plankton, it was preyed on by Archeops and Carracosta.

Omastar,139,Omastar is a Rock/Water type Pokémon introduced in Generation 1. It is known as the Spiral Pokémon.,"Omastar is a Pokémon similar to an ammonite. Its sky blue body has several tentacles; the tentacles toward the front are shorter and thicker than those in the back. There is a pale yellow, helix spiraled shell on its back. Several sharp spikes line the shell's midsection from the front to about halfway down its back. The shell's rim has two circular indents where Omastar's eyes are visible. Its eyes have yellow sclerae and vertically-slit pupils. It has an oval mouth with a four-sectioned, fang-like beak.

It is believed that Omastar's extinction was a consequence of the increasingly heavy weight of its own shell that affected its mobility, including its hunting. Omastar swam the seas in search of prey, including prehistoric Shellder. Omastar's used it tentacles to ensnare its prey before biting down with the deadly force of its beak. With the shell broken, it would suck out the contents. Omastar was in turn preyed upon by Carracosta. Omastar is thought to be a distant ancestor to Octillery.

It is mostly flat with a protective, brown shell covering its body. There are two small, black eyes on top of its shell, which it uses for sight when it hides on the ocean floor. Underneath the shell is a black space that hides the structure of its main body. Only its four short, yellow legs and a second pair of luminescent red eyes are visible on its underside. In its original time, Kabuto was prominently found on beaches, likely aided by its fast and powerful swimming ability. While it is commonly believed to be extinct, isolated populations of Kabuto have been found to be unchanged for 300 million years.

Kabutops,141,Kabutops is a Rock/Water type Pokémon introduced in Generation 1. It is known as the Shellfish Pokémon.,"Kabutops is a bipedal Pokémon with a skeletal build. It has a flat, half-circular head with a point on each side and two small eyes on the front. It is mostly brown, except for its light gray chest and abdomen. There is a ridge down its back with three flat spines on either side and it has a flat, pointed tail. Instead of hands, its forearms have large, sharp, gray scythes. Its thin legs are brown lead to small feet with two large gray claws.

Before it went extinct, Kabutops was in the process of evolving into a land dweller as evident by changes in its gills and legs. This change is thought to be due to its prey moving onto land as well. In its ocean home Kabutops could tuck up its limbs to help it swim extremely fast, up to roughly 29 knots. It used its sharp scythes to slice enemies and drink their internal fluids.

Aerodactyl,142,Aerodactyl is a Rock/Flying type Pokémon introduced in Generation 1. It is known as the Fossil Pokémon.,"Aerodactyl is a reptilian, bipedal Pokémon with large, membranous wings. It has small, sharply pointed ears, narrow eyes, a ridged snout with a gaping mouth, and strong lower jaw full of serrated fangs. Its body is covered in light purplish gray skin with violet wing membranes. Aerodactyl's wings consist of a membrane running from the side of the body to the tip of an elongated finger. The clawed hands at the bend of each wing allow it to grasp objects. There is a hump-like ridge with a single spike on its back and it has a strong tail with an arrow-shaped tip. Its talon-like feet have two toes in front and one in the back and are capable of scooping up and tightly clutching its prey in flight.

Aerodactyl is extant using Fossil revitalization, but is considered extinct in the wild. Due to the sharp appearance of Aerodactyl's fangs, it was originally thought to be exclusively a carnivore. However, the anime shows it joyfully consuming fruit. Its serrated fangs and ferocious attitude were nevertheless very imposing, and it is said to be have been capable of effortlessly ripping out enemies' throats. By spreading its impressive wings, Aerodactyl is believed to have flown by gliding through the skies, freely letting out its high-pitched cries. However, its walk was weak and slow when it touched ground. When at rest it enjoyed the safety and seclusion of the mountains, where it liked to nest.

When Aerodactyl Mega Evolves, its eyes turn green and body begins to turn to stone, which some researchers believe was its original appearance before fossilization. It grows larger in size and sprouts jagged black spikes all over its body: five spikes at the wrist joint of each wing replacing its hands, three small spikes along its tail, one spike on each ear, and a long spike on its chin. The spike on its back and its rear talons have also become black and stony. Rocky plates cover its eyebrows and the corners of its jaw. Similar stone ornaments are present on its chest on its torso: two small ridges flanking a longer ridge. Because of the burden of Mega Evolution, Mega Aerodactyl is fiercer and more irritable than before.

Snorlax,143,Snorlax is a Normal type Pokémon introduced in Generation 1. It is known as the Sleeping Pokémon.,"Snorlax is a huge, bipedal, dark blue-green Pokémon with a cream-colored face, belly, and feet. Its body is composed of mostly its belly, as its limbs are comparatively small. Its head is large with small, pointed ears and two pointed teeth protruding from its lower jaw. It has round feet, which both have three claws and a circular brown paw pad, and short arms with five claws on each hand. Snorlax's bulk makes it the heaviest Normal type.

Snorlax is often found in mountains and forests. It wakes up only to eat, requiring 900 lbs. (400 kg) of food per day before returning to its slumber. It is not a picky eater, as its strong stomach allows it to eat even moldy food without feeling any ill effects. It can even handle thorny plants or Muk's poison. It can also eat while it is resting. Snorlax is docile enough to let children and small Pokémon bounce on its large stomach.

Snorlax can show awesome power when prompted. It is the only known Pokémon capable of using the exclusive Z-Move Pulverizing Pancake.

Three blue, crystal orbs adorn its body: one on its neck and two on its tail.

Dragonair emits a gentle aura that gives it a mystical appearance. As seen in the anime, it can make its wings grow larger in order to fly, but otherwise moves through the air unaided. Dragonair hosts a large amount of energy within its body, which it can discharge through the crystals on its neck and tail.

Dragonite,149,Dragonite is a Dragon/Flying type Pokémon introduced in Generation 1. It is known as the Dragon Pokémon.,"Dragonite is a draconic, bipedal Pokémon with light orange skin. It has large, grayish-green eyes and a round snout with small nostrils. A pair of long, thin antennae sprout from the top of its head with a small horn set between them. Its striated underbelly is cream-colored and extends from its neck to the tip of its long, tapering tail. It has thick arms and legs ending in three claws each. The leg joints are well defined, while its arms have a smooth, rounded appearance. Dragonite's wings are small relative to its body with teal wing membranes.

Despite its bulky build, Dragonite is capable of flying faster than the speed of sound. It can circle the globe in sixteen hours, traveling roughly 1,556mph (2,505km/h), or about three times the speed of an average airplane. A kindhearted Pokémon with human-like intelligence, Dragonite shows signs of altruism: it is said to save humans from drowning and lead lost or foundering ships to safety. As demonstrated in the anime, however, it will go on an uncontrollable, destructive rampage if its environment is threatened. Dragonite is very rare in the wild, typically living near the sea. Some claim that there is an island somewhere in the ocean that only Dragonite inhabit. In the past, Outrage was its signature move.

Mewtwo,150,Mewtwo is a Psychic type Pokémon introduced in Generation 1. It is known as the Genetic Pokémon.,"Mewtwo is a Pokémon created by science. It is a bipedal, humanoid creature with some feline features. It is primarily gray with a long, purple tail. On top of its head are two short, blunt horns, and it has purple eyes. A tube extends from the back of its skull to the top of its spine, bypassing its neck. It has a defined chest and shoulders, which resemble a breastplate. The three digits on each hand and foot have spherical tips. Its tail is thick at the base, but thins before ending in a small bulb.

Mega Mewtwo X is larger and bulkier than its normal state. The horns on its head are longer and extend from V-shaped ridges on its forehead. Additionally, the horns are now pointed and curve upward. It now has two tubes behind its neck, its eyes are light blue, and it has large, purple growths over its shoulders. Its torso is smooth and small compared to its long, bulky limbs, and a Y-shaped line connects the collar and underbelly. Its forearms and thighs each have two raised ridges and its digits are now longer and thinner. The tail is slightly shorter and stiffer than before and has a curled tip. Its muscles are augmented with psychic power, which increases its strength and sprinting abilities. When using moves in battle, it is shown to be able to stretch its arms and legs.

In comparison, Mega Mewtwo Y is smaller and lighter, losing its long tail and the tube behind its neck. However, it grows a long, purple appendage with a curled tip from the back of its head that is similar to its previous form's tail. On its head it has two pointed, backward-curving spikes and a half-ring structure connecting to base of each and crossing over the top of its head. Its eyes are now red and slightly larger. The digits on its hands and feet are now purple and more bulbous and the middle toe is longer than the others. A bumpy ridge similar to a sternum replaces the breastplate structure on its chest, but this form is still largely smoother than the other two. Despite its size, it has phenomenal mental power, and is capable of smashing buildings with a mere thought.

Mewtwo was created after years of horrific gene splicing and DNA engineering experiments based on Mew. It is said to have the most savage heart among all Pokémon, lack compassion, and strike fear into its enemy with cold, glowing eyes. Because it was engineered to be the ultimate in battle, it can only think of defeating its foes. In the first movie, where it was shown to be capable of levitation, telepathy and mind control, Mewtwo exemplified these vicious characteristics. However, it was later shown to be caring, protective, and even altruistic. Another Mewtwo in the anime shared its aversion to contact with others, but was much less belligerent.

Mewtwo conserves energy by remaining motionless in order to unleash its full power in battle. It is also capable of materializing psychic waves in the form of its signature move, Psystrike. Though rarely seen in the wild, it is said to be resting in a dark cave somewhere.

Mew,151,Mew is a Psychic type Pokémon introduced in Generation 1. It is known as the New Species Pokémon.,"Mew is a pink, bipedal Pokémon with mammalian features. It has a rounded, wide snout, triangular ears, and large, blue eyes. It has short arms with three-fingered paws and large hind paws with oval markings on the soles. Its tail is long and thin with an ovoid tip. Its fur is so fine and thin, it can only be seen under a microscope. Mew is said to have the DNA of every single Pokémon contained within its body, and as such is able to learn any attack.

As demonstrated by its behavior in the first and eighth Pokémon movies, it shows signs of intelligence, curiosity, playfulness, and even selflessness. Mew is incredibly adaptable, able to travel freely in the air or underwater. As seen in Pokémon Snap and the Super Smash Bros. series, it can create a green, yellow, or pink orb of energy around itself for protection, although only the pink orb is seen in the latter.

Reports found in Cinnabar Island's Pokémon Mansion note scientific expeditions that have sighted Mew in Guyana, South America, the place where it was first discovered. Since Mew can make itself invisible at will, very few people have knowingly seen it, leading some scientists to declare it extinct and most to assume it to be a mirage. It will only show itself to a person who is pure of heart.

Mew  is the only known Pokémon capable of using the exclusive Z-Move Genesis Supernova.

Its own fur is non-flammable, which protects it from other fire attacks. Quilava tends to be rare in the wild, but can sometimes be found living on grasslands.

While most of its body is blue, its lower jaw is yellow and there is an asymmetrical, yellow-and-blue pattern around its chest that resembles a spotted animal skin.

Although Croconaw is described as always having forty-eight fangs lining its mouth, only six are discernible. The tips of its teeth are slanted backward similar to a barbed fish hook; this makes them impossible to remove once embedded in something. If it loses any teeth, they will quickly grow back.

On its lower body is a yellow, V-shaped marking that extends up to its thighs; there is a thin line through the center of the marking. Its arms have five clawed fingers and its feet three clawed toes.

Feraligatr opens its powerful jaws to intimidate its foes and viciously shakes its head once it clamps down on foes or prey. Because it has difficulty supporting its weight out of water, it has been known to move on all fours. However, when hunting or fighting it is agile and fast, due to its powerful hind legs. Feraligatr can rarely be found living near the water’s edge.

It has cream-colored tips on its ears, two brown, whisker-like markings on each cheek, and round, black eyes. Its four limbs are stubby; the forepaws are brown and the hind paws cream-colored. Furret is capable of standing on its hind legs, but prefers to move on all fours. Its body and tail are so similar in structure that it is impossible to tell where its tail begins. 

Despite its short limbs, Furret is very quick and agile. Its speed allows it to catch prey such as Rattata. It tends to burrow under the ground of meadows and other temperate grasslands. Its narrow burrows are well-suited for its slim body and are very difficult for other Pokémon to enter. The burrows also become more maze-like deeper inside, which makes it even harder to find Furret’s nest. A mother Furret curls itself around its offspring to help them sleep.

Encircling its eyes are black rings; the lower rims of the ring have three protrusions that resemble the teeth on a gear while the upper rims have extensions that resemble the hands of a clock. It has two pinkish feet, each with five clawed toes. However, it will typically only stand on one foot at a time and alternates between the two at speeds too difficult to track with the naked eye.

Hoothoot begins crying at exactly the same time every day and always tilts its head in the same rhythm. This ability is due to a special organ that senses the Earth's rotation and allows it to keep track of time. As a result, Hoothoot was considered a divine messenger of time and raised to serve as clocks a long time ago. Some Trainers still use it as a clock today. Hoothoot is most commonly found nesting in trees in temperate and boreal forests.

Noctowl is a nocturnal Pokémon that is called ""the emperor of dark nights"" by some. It has exceptional eyes that concentrate the faintest light and give it night vision, supple wings capable of silent flight, and it can twist its head at a 180 degree angle to increase its intellect. Its superior senses and intellect allow it catch prey without fail in the darkness. It can also turn its head upside down, which signals that it is troubled by something.

It has six black legs with white hands that resemble boxing gloves.

Ledyba is a social Pokémon that is active in large groups. If left alone, it becomes timid and afraid to move. It is also very sensitive to cold, so it forms clusters with other Ledyba for warmth. An aromatic fluid is secreted from its feet and leg joints, which it uses for communication. The fluid indicates its location and conveys emotion; it will smell sour if Ledyba is angry. In the anime, it has been shown to serve a role in pollinating the fruit-producing plants of the Pokémon world and is usually instructed to do so by means of a special whistle. However, like most Pokémon, it will also respond to regular vocal commands. Ledyba builds its nest on leaves in temperate forests and jungles and joins with other Ledyba to protect its home when needed.

Both pairs have green-blue membranes, but the lower pair’s membranes are only visible from the back. The upper wings have two claw-like fingers near the middle. On the bottom of its body are what appear to be a pair of stubby feet or tufts of fur.

Crobat is capable of flying long distances by alternating between its two sets of wings. The extra set of wings has also improved its flight speed without sacrificing its ability to fly silently. The combination of silent flight and sharp fangs allows it bite down on prey without being noticed and drain their blood. If unable to consume blood, it becomes lethargic and unable to fly.

Positioned on its rear where its tail would be are a pair of antennae that curve up and over its head. The antennae developed from fins and have yellow, teardrop-shaped orbs at the tips.

Prey is lured toward Chinchou by the soft glow from the orbs on its antennae. It also flashes its light to communicate with others of its kind and claim territory. Inside the antennae are electricity-generating cells that create so much electrical power that they even make Chinchou tingle slightly. By discharging positive and negative electricity, it can both defend itself and stun its prey. Chinchou lives on dark ocean floors, rarely ever coming up to the surface. However, it has demonstrated the ability to walk on land in the anime.

Mareep's wool, which grows continuously, stores electricity, rubbing together and building a static charge. Its volume increases when it builds up with electricity. Touching the wool when it is charged will result in a static shock. During the summer, the fleece is shed, but it grows back in a week. Air is also stored in its fur, which allows it to stay cool during summer and warm during winter. It tends to avoid battle in the wild and has a mild disposition. Mareep is most often found in grassy fields, though it can also be found in farms where its wool is used in high-quality clothing.

Bellossom,182,Bellossom is a Grass type Pokémon introduced in Generation 2. It is known as the Flower Pokémon.,"Bellossom is a primarily green Pokémon with circular blue eyes and red markings on its cheeks. It has two bright red flowers on its head and green and yellow leaves around its waist that resemble a skirt, all adding to the appearance of a hula dancer. Bellossom's petals are said to be more beautiful the worse the Gloom it evolved from smelled. When it rubs the petals on its head together, it creates a pleasing sound. Bellossom does not possess feet; in the anime, its center-most leaves bent as it was getting ready to spring, suggesting that it uses its leaves as substitutes for feet or legs. However, the Pokédex does classify it as a biped.

Bellossom is often seen dancing and chanting. In particular, Bellossom dances when cloudy weather persists, or when the heavy rainfall season ends and it is drawn out by the warm sunlight. Being the result of an evolution via evolutionary stone, Bellosom is rarely found in the wild, though they can be found in grassy plains.

Marill,183,Marill is a Water/Fairy type Pokémon introduced in Generation 2. It is known as the Aqua Mouse Pokémon.,"Marill is a small, blue bipedal Pokémon. It has a nearly spherical shape with a white belly, and has round ears with red insides. These sensitive ears can detect distant sounds. Its arms and feet are short and possess no visible digits. There is a blue, bubble-like ball at the tip of its zigzagging black tail. The tail is flexible and configured to stretch, and the ball is full of oil. The oil is lighter than water, and keeps Marill afloat in the water. In the anime, Marill was shown to be able to bounce on its tail.

Marill is able to swim in strong water currents without being slowed down by the water's resistance, due to its water-repellent fur. Marill feeds on aquatic plants in addition to fishing for food. When it dives, its tail can be seen bobbing on the water's surface. It will anchor its tail around a tree when fishing at the edge of a fast moving stream. It lives on the water's edge.

The lower half of its body is white with a white, bubble-like pattern above it, which helps to camouflage it in water. It has elongated, rabbit-like ears with red insides and circular eyes. When in the water, it rolls up its ears to prevent the insides from becoming wet. Its arms and feet are short with rounded ends and no discernible digits. It has a black zigzagging tail with a blue, bubble-like tip.

Azumarill has highly developed hearing that allows it to hear distances, even when it is underwater. By keeping still and listening closely, it can identity prey even in wild, fast-moving rivers. If Azumarill spots a drowning Pokémon, it will make a balloon out of air that helps them breathe. It lives in rivers and lakes, and can live in the water all day long.

Sudowoodo,185,Sudowoodo is a Rock type Pokémon introduced in Generation 2. It is known as the Imitation Pokémon.,"Sudowoodo has a brown, log-shaped body with yellow spots. It has short legs with toeless feet and thin forelegs with three green spheres at the ends. It has a forked ""branch"" on top of its head, which is shorter on the female than on the male. Despite its appearance, Sudowoodo's composition is closer to a rock than a plant.

Sudowoodo disguises itself as a tree and stands along paths to avoid being attacked. Its camouflage fails in the winter, as its forelegs remain green unlike real trees. Sudowoodo is very weak to water and hates it, so it flees when it starts to rain. Because it holds its position for so long, its arms have become supple yet strong. It is popular with the elderly, with available magazines and fans devoted to its arm angle and length. Sudowoodo can be found living in forests.

Politoed acts as a leader to Poliwag and Poliwhirl, which gather from afar upon hearing its cry. Politoed likes to expand its throat and sing. When three or more assemble, they sing in a chorus with a loud, bellowing voice. The curled hair on Politoed's head is considered proof of its status as a king. The longer and curlier Politoed's hair is, the more Poliwag and Poliwhirl will obey it, and the more it is respected by other Politoed. Politoed is rarely found in the wild, though it is usually seen living by the water's edge.

Hoppip's body is very light, and it is easily lifted off the ground by winds and will drift in the air. Hoppip can sense approaching strong winds. In order to avoid being blown away, it clusters and links leaves with other Hoppip or grips the ground firmly with its feet. However, it enjoys gentle breezes. Hoppip lives in temperate grasslands, although some also drift through fields, mountains, and even urban environments.

It has large, flat ears on the sides of its head and oval, red eyes with no pupils. On top of its head is a yellow bloom with a white center. Skiploom spreads its petals to absorb as much sunlight as possible. The bloom on top of its head opens and closes as the temperature fluctuates and its flower blossoms when the temperature rises above 64 °F (18 °C). Because of this, it is sometimes used as a thermometer. It floats in the air to try to get closer to the sun, but closes its flower and immediately hides under the shade of a tree when it rains. Skiploom lives in temperate grasslands. As seen in the games, the bloom on its head can turn clockwise.

These puffs produce cotton spores that it can use to float in the air, and it can control its flight even in a hurricane. Three to four leaves grow at the base of the top puff.

Jumpluff drifts on seasonal winds and can use its spores to masterfully maneuver itself around the globe. It will spread spores as it floats around to create offspring. It descends if it encounters cold air currents while it is floating. Though it spends a good amount of time in the air, it is commonly sighted above open temperate grasslands.

Aipom,190,Aipom is a Normal type Pokémon introduced in Generation 2. It is known as the Long Tail Pokémon.,"Aipom is a monkey-like Pokémon with a three-fingered hand at the end of its tail. Its fur is purple, while the skin of its face, inner ears, belly, feet, and the tip of its tail are beige. Its face usually has a cheeky smile and round, blue eyes. With its round ears, Aipom's head is disproportionately large compared to its body. Atop its head is a cowlick that is longer on females than males. Unlike its feet, Aipom's arms are simple, purple stubs.

Aipom uses its powerful tail freely and cleverly for many purposes. The tail is strong enough to anchor Aipom to a branch and suspend the rest of its body in the air, but also delicate enough to pick fruit and manipulate objects. Aipom has been known to wrap its tail around tree branches as it sleeps so it does not fall. Since Aipom uses its tail so much, its actual arms are not as dexterous and become clumsy over time. Aipom lives high in the treetops of tropical, temperate and even boreal forests, using its tail for balance as it swings from branch to branch. In Alola, Bounsweet is its favorite food.

Two of the stripes start jaggedly above Sunkern's dark eyes and continue downward. The other stripe is directly below Sunkern's mouth. Since Sunkern's eyelids are brown, the brown streak patterning appears uninterrupted when Sunkern's eyes are closed.

Sunkern is known to be very weak. Aware of its weakness, it only feeds until it evolves. However, it feeds on only the dew from under the leaves of plants. It tries to move as little as possible, since it tries to conserve all the nutrients it has stored in its body for evolution. If attacked, it shakes its leaves at the attacker. Sunkern occasionally falls from the sky on early mornings for unknown reasons. A year after a cold summer, the population of Sunkern explodes. Sunkern can be found in temperate, grassy meadows.

It has purple, branching gills on either side of its head; the males have more branches in its gills than the females. Wooper stands on two small, round feet, and it has a large, thick tail. On its belly are dark blue curved markings.

It is implied in the anime that Wooper is a dull-witted Pokémon oblivious to its surroundings. Wooper lives in cold water most of the time. When sleeping, it partially buries itself in the mud at the bottom. It will occasionally leave the water when the air cools in the evening to search for food along the shore. While walking on land, it coats its body with a slimy, toxic film that keeps its skin from dehydrating and insulates against the cold. The film causes a shooting pain if touched barehanded.

Its head is broad and round, having little neck to distinguish it from the rest of Quagsire's body. It has a wide mouth and tiny, black eyes. A wavy, purple stripe runs down its back. Along its spine is a dark blue fin, which is larger on the male than on the female. Quagsire's hands and feet both have three digits. Its outer layer of skin is slimy and slippery.

Quagsire is carefree and sluggish by nature. An unintelligent Pokémon, it tends to bump its head inadvertently while swimming and seems not to care. It hunts for food by leaving its mouth wide open in water and waiting for its unaware prey to blunder in. Because Quagsire does not move, it does not get very hungry and can afford to wait for its food. Quagsire lives in clean bodies of freshwater and muddy swamps.

In the anime, wild Quagsire are shown to have an annual celebration at Blue Moon Falls when the moon is full. There they attempt to shoot round objects they have collected to the top of a waterfall with their attacks to see who can launch their objects the highest, with the apparent target being the moon.

Espeon,196,Espeon is a Psychic type Pokémon introduced in Generation 2. It is known as the Sun Pokémon.,"Espeon is a quadruped, mammalian Pokémon with slender legs and dainty paws. It is covered in fine, lilac fur. This velvety fur is sensitive for Espeon to sense minute shifts in the air, thus allowing it to predict the weather. Its ears are large, and it has purple eyes with white pupils. There are tufts of fur near its eyes, and a small, red gem embedded in its forehead. The gem boosts the psychic powers that it gained to protect its Trainer from harm. It also has a thin, forked tail that quivers when it predicts its opponent's moves. Espeon is rare in the wilderness, and is more commonly found in urban areas.

Murkrow,198,Murkrow is a Dark/Flying type Pokémon introduced in Generation 2. It is known as the Darkness Pokémon.,"Murkrow is an avian Pokémon with black feathers. Its crooked, yellow beak and the three, feathery tufts on its head resemble a witch's nose and hat respectively. The feathery crest is smaller on the female than on the male. It has semi-circular, red eyes with white sclerae and pupils and a spiky collar of feathers around its neck. The shaggy feathers on its tail resemble the end of a broom, and there is a thin, red band at the base of the tail. Its yellow feet have four toes, three facing forward and one backward.

Murkrow has a fondness for anything sparkly, and it will go as far as fighting with other Pokémon, such as Meowth or Gabite, in order to gain their stashes. Whenever it is chased, it loses the attacker by leading it down dark mountain trails, and sometimes it does this to travelers as a mean spirited prank. Its thieving and nocturnal nature has led it to become representative of misfortune. It is possible to train a Murkrow to repeat words, as seen under Team Rocket's ownership. Murkrow usually live in flocks amongst forests and swamps.

Slowking,199,Slowking is a Water/Psychic type Pokémon introduced in Generation 2. It is known as the Royal Pokémon.,"Slowking is a bipedal Pokémon with a Shellder latched onto its head. It is primarily pink, with a pale yellow muzzle and scaled belly. Its feet and hands each have a single clawed digit, while the hands also have a clawless thumb. Around its neck is a spiny ruff with alternating red and white stripes. The Shellder on its head has a spiral shape with two horns near the base. A red gem resides in the center of the Shellder.

Shellder's bite releases venom into Slowpoke's brain, causing a chemical chain-reaction that unlocks a superior intelligence and extraordinary power. More venom is injected into Slowking every time it yawns. The more venom the Shellder releases, the more intelligent Slowking will become. However, if the Shellder on its head comes off, it will forget everything it has learned. Slowking's intelligence can match that of a human and it constantly attempts to learn more. Its inspiration and intuition are also highly developed, and Slowking is able to stay calm in any situation and plan situations with effective results. In the anime, it can understand and speak the human language. According to The Complete Pokémon Pocket Guide, it has such an easy-going personality that it is never stressed. Slowking is rarely found in the wild, though it can be found by the water's edge. It has been seen eating seaweed and drinking coconut milk. In Alola, Slowking occasionally matches wits with Oranguru by the beach.

While it has no visible arms or legs, its lower half has several small appendages and resembles a ruffled dress. It has several round red gems around its neck, which are used to absorb fear and use it as nourishment. It has long, flowing lilac-tipped ""hair"". Misdreavus's large, red eyes have yellow sclerae.

Misdreavus lives in caves. As a nocturnal Pokémon, it spends its days sleeping in darkness and its nights startling people with mischievous tricks. Since it loves watching frightened people, it is known to yank and bite at people's hair or sneak up on them and cry and shriek. Previously, it was the only known Pokémon that could learn Pain Split by level up.

Unown,201,Unown is a Psychic type Pokémon introduced in Generation 2. It is known as the Symbol Pokémon.,"Unown is a flat, thin Pokémon shaped like an eye with appendages that make it resemble a letter or a punctuation mark. It is entirely black, except for its white sclerae. All twenty-six alphabetic forms of Unown have fully open eyes while the two punctuation Unown have half-closed eyes. Though each of its forms has a counterpart in the Latin alphabet, Unown is said to resemble ancient writing and hieroglyphs. It is a mystery whether Unown predates or postdates written language, and therefore which one is based on the other.

The Pokédex and Professor Oak's research disagree on whether Unown communicates using electromagnetic waves or telepathy. Either way, it can be detected by the Pokégear radio, which interprets it as the melody of the Azure Flute. It is said that an ""odd power"" emerges when more than one Unown come together. In the anime, it is capable of reading the thoughts of other life forms. Great numbers of Unown are capable of distorting the reality to suit the dreams and wishes of whoever is in control of the Unown. However, they can only do this when more Unown are present, so it could be a shared effort rather than an ability unique to each Unown.

Unown is an extremely rare Pokémon that lives in its own dimension and rarely ventures outside. When it moves to the Pokémon world, Unown tends to stick to walls like engravings of ancient texts or orbit other Unown.

It has flat arms that are wider towards the tip and four stubby legs at the base of its body. There are two eyespots on its black tail. Wobbuffet is very protective of its tail, to the point where it will suddenly turn uncharacteristically aggressive if the tail is attacked.

Wobbuffet is usually a docile Pokémon that will never attack first. However, when it is attacked, it will inflate its body and initiate a counterstrike. When two or more of this Pokémon meet, they will attempt to outlast each other in a battle of endurance. However, since neither is able to attack, they may compete to see which can last without food. Because of its overprotective nature regarding its tail and hatred of light, Wobbuffet lives in dark caves.

Its front half is yellow with black spots, while its back half is black with yellow spots. The female Girafarig has a smaller dark section than the male. There are many triangular, pink spikes along its back.

Girafarig's tail possesses a head of its own. The tail's head has yellow eyes, a mouth full of sharp teeth, and a small brain. However, this head is incapable of independent thinking and relies on outside stimuli such as smell to guide its actions. If the tail smells something alluring, it will bite. The tail often mimics the head during feeding, and is able to warn the Pokémon of danger if it is sleeping. Girafarig lives in savannas and grasslands, where it feeds on the plant life.

It has a single spike on top of its head, which is supposedly its stem. It makes its shell thicker by gluing tree bark to its body. The glue is made of fluid that Pineco spits out, which hardens when it is exposed to air. Unbothered by the added weight of its shell, it patiently hangs from a tree branch in tropical and temperate forests, waiting to prey on flying insects. In Alola, its favorite prey is Cutiefly.

The inner shell is punctuated by four cylindrical spikes, each tapering to an open point. Between the spikes, the inner shell opens along a straight line to reveal Forretress's eyes, which are round with large pupils. Whatever else lies inside its shell is unknown.

Forretress can defend itself from enemies by shooting out pieces of its outer shell, as a conditioned reflex rather than a conscious effort. It opens its shell to capture prey, but this happens so quickly that its interior body cannot be seen. It lives in tropical and temperate forests, attaching itself immovably to tree trunks.

Gligar has a long tail split into spherical sections, ending in a large, round stinger. The female Gligar will have a smaller stinger than the male.

As shown in the anime, Gligar feed on Berries and can emit sound waves to detect obstacles and fly around them.

It attacks by clamping onto its enemy's face with its clawed hind legs and pincers, then jabbing it with its poisonous stinger. Gligar lives in mountainous regions, making its nest along cliff sides. When it is done gliding, it hops along the ground back to its nest.

Steelix,208,Steelix is a Steel/Ground type Pokémon introduced in Generation 2. It is known as the Iron Snake Pokémon.,"Steelix is a long, serpentine Pokémon with a silvery-gray body made up of rock-like sections, which can possess chips and scrapes from fights and tunneling. Three of those sections have long rock spikes coming out of them on either side. It has a massive head mainly made up of its large, wide jaw with sets of large square teeth inside. Along it bottom jaw are ridges: there are two pairs of ridges on a male Steelix, while there is only one pair on a female. Several small, square lumps cover the underside of its lower jaw. Its eye sockets are slightly deep set, and the eyes themselves are red. Its head has two long ridges going from the eyes up to the top of its head. The tip of its tail is conical with a blunt tip.

As Mega Steelix, its body becomes longer, almost doubles its mass, and gains more features. Mega Steelix's eyes turn blue and its lower jaw becomes more heavily armored with a round, curved shape. Additionally, a third pair of ridges appears on its bottom jaw, as well as two sharp, flat structures consisting of three conjoined projections on each side. The gray, rock-like spikes and its tail point have transformed into prism-like crystalline spikes; the segments from which the spikes protrude are much larger as well. In-between the head and individual spiked segments are smaller units, now adorned by a black spot with a blue hexagon on each side. Several metallic-looking scraps constantly rotate around its neck; these scraps react to Mega Steelix's movements and change position when attacking. The cells within its body, crystallized by the energy produced from Mega Evolution, are stronger than any mineral and able to withstand any temperature. It moves incredibly slowly, but its strengthened body is also impervious to damage, and it lashes out at foes without flinching. [1]

Steelix burrows up to six-tenths of a mile underground and can be found in mountains or caves. It easily chews through boulders with its powerful jaws, and its eyes are capable of seeing in the dark. Exposure to underground heat and pressures alongside its iron-rich soil diet have made its body harder than diamonds.

Along it bottom jaw are ridges: there are two pairs of ridges on a male Steelix, while there is only one pair on a female. Several small, square lumps cover the underside of its lower jaw. Its eye sockets are slightly deep set, and the eyes themselves are red. Its head has two long ridges going from the eyes up to the top of its head. The tip of its tail is conical with a blunt tip.

As Mega Steelix, its body becomes longer, almost doubles its mass, and gains more features. Mega Steelix's eyes turn blue and its lower jaw becomes more heavily armored with a round, curved shape. Additionally, a third pair of ridges appears on its bottom jaw, as well as two sharp, flat structures consisting of three conjoined projections on each side. The gray, rock-like spikes and its tail point have transformed into prism-like crystalline spikes; the segments from which the spikes protrude are much larger as well. In-between the head and individual spiked segments are smaller units, now adorned by a black spot with a blue hexagon on each side. Several metallic-looking scraps constantly rotate around its neck; these scraps react to Mega Steelix's movements and change position when attacking. The cells within its body, crystallized by the energy produced from Mega Evolution, are stronger than any mineral and able to withstand any temperature. It moves incredibly slowly, but its strengthened body is also impervious to damage, and it lashes out at foes without flinching. [1]

Steelix burrows up to six-tenths of a mile underground and can be found in mountains or caves. It easily chews through boulders with its powerful jaws, and its eyes are capable of seeing in the dark. Exposure to underground heat and pressures alongside its iron-rich soil diet have made its body harder than diamonds.

Scizor,212,Scizor is a Bug/Steel type Pokémon introduced in Generation 2. It is known as the Pincer Pokémon.,"Scizor is a bipedal, insectoid Pokémon with a red, metallic exoskeleton. It has gray, retractable forewings and hind wings with simple, curved venation. Its head is kite-shaped with three blunt horns extending above its forehead, and dark yellow eyes. Scizor's neck and part of its thorax give the appearance of being exposed: they show black skin, and are surrounded by its raised exoskeleton. Scizor has a large abdomen with three black, pointed stripes below the waist; the female has a larger abdomen than the male. Scizor has broad shoulders and thin, segmented arms ending in large, round pincers. Scizor's legs are defined by large hip joints, thin thighs, and wide calves, its feet ending in one clawed toe in front and another in the back.

Mega Scizor's pincers lengthen and develop serrations. The lower half of the claws turns white and gains three pointed spikes on the underside. The barbs on Mega Scizor's claws can stab through concrete, and opponents caught in them are unable to escape.[1] Its eyespots are now blue with a thin black rim. Though they lack the black rim, its eyes are blue as well. Additional pieces of black armoring appear on various area of its body: a three-pointed crest on its forehead and striated coverings on its shoulders and thighs. Mega Scizor's legs are less detailed and resemble large, tapered spikes with white tips. While Mega Scizor is formidable, it cannot maintain this form for extended periods of time; after too long, its body starts to melt and it loses the strength to wield its heavy pincers.

Scizor's body is as hard as steel, with claws strong enough to crush any hard object. They can be opened and closed like jaws, and are patterned with black, eyespots with yellow ""pupils"". It will raise its claws and wave them around to scare off predators or foes, giving it the appearance of having three heads. Scizor is incapable of flight, instead quickly flapping its wings to regulate its body temperature. Scizor is rarely found in the wild, though it can be found in grasslands.

Mega Heracross is bulkier than its previous form. Thin orange markings now rim its head, hands, and shoulders. Additionally, there is a half-circle, orange marking over its eyes. It now has a long, pointed nose that curves slightly upward. Its back now lacks wings and is completely yellow. The horn on its head has grown into a large, simple spike with two smaller spikes on the front. The antennae have lengthened as well, and now have ovoid tips.

Slugma,218,Slugma is a Fire type Pokémon introduced in Generation 2. It is known as the Lava Pokémon.,"Slugma is a limbless Pokémon composed of magma. Its body is bright red, fading to a duller red along its extremities. It has large, round, yellow eyes with small pupils. Slugma's head is ovoid with flame-like extensions spreading upward from its eyes and round, stable drops of magma dangling from its upper jaw. Its lower body is irregular in shape, and occasionally emits bubbles.

Slugma's circulatory system is composed entirely of magma, which delivers vital nutrients and oxygen to its organs. In order to prevent its body from cooling and hardening, Slugma neither sleeps nor ever stops moving. If its body does begin to cool, it will become brittle and may break apart. Slugma constantly seeks warm places, and gathers with other members of its species in mountains and volcanoes.

Magcargo,219,Magcargo is a Fire/Rock type Pokémon introduced in Generation 2. It is known as the Lava Pokémon.,"Magcargo is a limbless, snail-like Pokémon consisting almost entirely of bright red magma. Its oval eyes are large and yellow with small pupils, and extend upward from its head. It has a bulbous snout and a wide mouth, with two drops of magma dangling from each side of its upper jaw. Magcargo's back is protected by a gray, spherical shell composed of hardened, but brittle magma, forming irregular lumps and plates. A streak of fire leaks from the side of its shell. Magcargo's lower body is amorphous and covered in bubbles of magma.

Magcargo's internal body temperature can reach over 18,000 °F (10,000 °C), causing it to evaporate water on contact. Flames circulate throughout its body, occasionally spouting through cracks in its shell. While its shell is brittle enough to be shattered with a slight touch, Magcargo can reform its body by dipping itself in magma. It can be found in mountainous regions, and has been living in volcano craters for tens of thousands of years.

Swinub,220,Swinub is an Ice/Ground type Pokémon introduced in Generation 2. It is known as the Pig Pokémon.,"Living in frigid temperatures, Swinub is covered in dense, brown, striped hair to keep it warm. The hair is so shaggy that it often covers its tuft-like small legs, making it appear like a legless lump. Swinub's eyes appear as if they are perpetually closed. Swinub uses its pink, pig-like nose to dig through mud and snow, looking for anything edible. Occasionally, it will come across hot springs while scouring the ground. Its favorite food is a type of mushroom that grows beneath dead grass, though it also eats Berries. When a Swinub finds an attractive smell, it will run desperately to find out the source of the aroma. It inhabits cold places, such as icy caves, mountainous regions, and frozen tundra.

It also has two tusks made of ice, which seem small but can be lethal. These tusks thicken when it snows, and they are smaller on a female Piloswine than on a male. It has floppy ears that are sensitive to sound. Piloswine has two beady eyes in its head; however, these are usually covered up by tufts of fur. As it is usually unable to see, it checks surroundings with its sensitive pig-like nose instead. Its hair is so long that it usually covers its small, hoofed legs. Despite the small size of its legs, its hooves ensure even footing on icy ground. Piloswine tend to inhabit cold places, such as icy caves, mountainous regions and frozen tundra. It often digs for food buried beneath snow and ice.

It is known as the Coral Pokémon.,"Corsola is a small, pink, roundish Pokémon with branch-like growths on its back, which are similar to coral. There is a smaller, blunt horn on its forehead, and it has black, oval eyes. It has a white underside, which speckles towards the sides. Its four legs and two arms are blunt and stubby. Found in the warm shallow waters of southern seas, Corsola requires clean water to live. If its habitat is dirty, the growths on its back become discolored and degenerate. However, when it is healthy, its growths regularly shed and grow back. It is able to regrow them over the course of a single night. It forms large social groups. Occasionally, these groups get so large that people may live atop them, as is the case in Pacifidlog Town. Corsola's horn is a prized material, commonly used for jewelry and carving as seen in the anime. Smaller Pokémon like Seadra and Luvdisc are sometimes sheltered by Corsola's branches, and even offer it protection from foes.

In the Alola region, Mareanie and Toxapex are natural predators of Corsola.

Remoraid,223,Remoraid is a Water type Pokémon introduced in Generation 2. It is known as the Jet Pokémon.,"Remoraid is a light blue, fish-like Pokémon with saucer-like eyes, and a mouth with four pointed teeth. There are two dark stripes on its back that resembles the barrel of a revolver. It has a single pelvic fin positioned like a revolver's trigger, two small pectoral fins, and a dorsal fin near its mouth resembling a gun's front sight. In addition, it has two caudal fins, the bottom of which resembling the butt of a gun and the top resembling the hammer. All of its fins except for the dorsal fin are white.

Remoraid is well known for its ability to shoot jets of water from the surface with incredible accuracy and distance, often to shoot down flying insect prey out of the air. It tends to travel by attaching to Mantine's fins or in large groups of its own kind. When attached to a Mantine, it feeds on whatever the Mantine leaves behind, but will fight alongside it as well. Remoraid is a sea-dwelling Pokémon, but when evolution draws near, Remoraid travels downstream from rivers.

Octillery,224,Octillery is a Water type Pokémon introduced in Generation 2. It is known as the Jet Pokémon.,"Octillery is a red, cephalopod-like Pokémon with large, round eyes and a turret-like mouth. There are yellow bumps on its rock-hard head and yellow suction cups on each of its eight tentacles. These suction cups and yellow bumps are smaller on a female Octillery. It uses its tentacles for manipulating objects and the suction cups give it strong gripping power. Because of this, it is very hard for it to be blown away. Octillery is the only known Pokémon that learns Octazooka naturally.

Octillery is a relaxed Pokémon who loves fuss from its Trainer. In the wild, it will spurt ink containing substances that dull predators' sense of smell to protect its young from danger. Even though it is more docile when domesticated, it can be very stubborn at times in the wild. It instinctively sneaks into rocky holes, and if it gets sleepy, it steals the nest of a fellow Octillery. It sometimes sprays ink on prey by sticking out only its mouth, and its suction cups hold prey tightly. Octillery is normally found in oceans.

It is also thought to be a distant relative to Omastar.

There is a single white spot on its stomach. Its feet have two digits each.

Delibird is omnivorous. It carries food bundled up in its tail. It normally gives stored food to its chicks, but has been known to share its food with humans stranded on icy mountains. Delibird's signature move, Present, allows it to carry special items in its tail that may cause damage or heal its opponent. In a flock, the Delibird with the largest tail is its leader. Delibird tends to live in mountainous regions, making its nests over sharp cliffs; one notable area of the world is around Mt. Everest.

It has a streamer-like tail and long ""antennae"". Two pairs of gills are visible on its gray underside, as well as a pair of beady eyes and a small mouth. Generally, it is pictured with a Remoraid attached to the underside of one wing, much like a cleaner fish. Mantine can fly 300 feet into the air if it builds up enough speed, in a similar manner to how real-life manta rays breach the surface. Mantine is mostly docile. It thrives in open seas.

In Alola, many surfers ride waves and travel between islands on the backs of Mantine. This has made it an icon in the region, being featured on souvenir postcards and posters.

Skarmory,227,Skarmory is a Steel/Flying type Pokémon introduced in Generation 2. It is known as the Armor Bird Pokémon.,"Skarmory is a silver-gray, avian Pokémon with a long, metallic blue neck, legs, and tail. It has yellow eyes, a pointed beak with several pointed teeth, and a triangular crest on its head. There are red feathers under the sheaths that cover its sharp wings, and each feather can be moved independently. Its wings are actually hollow, allowing it to travel up to 180 mph (300 km/h). Its feet have three toes on them, two in front and one in back, and its tail has hooked ends.

Its steel wings become tattered and bashed in from repeated battles, but once a year the battered wings grow back completely. This process restores the cutting edges. Its feathers are sharp enough to be used as blades. Its skin and feathers are solid because it lives and is raised in very harsh conditions. Its nests are usually found in thorn bushes, where continual scratching of its skin will eventually harden it into an iron-like state. However, water can cause Skarmory's hard body to rust easily, so it stays in its nest on rainy days. In ancient Alola, warriors would use the sharp feathers that fell off Skarmory as swords.

Two fangs protrude from its upper jaw, and its triangular nose is black. There are white bands on its ankles, and rib-like ridges on its back. Houndour appears to have a simplistic, stylized skull on its forehead with the eye orbits creating eyebrow patterning above its actual eyes. It also has circular, red paw pads on each of its three-toed paws.

Houndour is an intelligent Pokémon that forms packs to hunt for prey, and shows unparalleled teamwork. As seen in the anime, it will not abandon a sick pack member. It communicates using various barks and howls. Barks are used to determine the location of a pack member during a hunt, while howls are used as declaration of ownership over a territory. They are known to be loyal and obedient to their Trainers. Houndour can typically be found around rough terrain.

It is known as the Dark Pokémon.,"Houndoom is a quadruped, canine Pokémon that is mainly black with a long orange snout and an orange underbelly. It has small, red eyes and a black nose. Around its neck is a white band with a small skull-shaped pendant on its throat. There are two white bands on each of its ankles, as well as three rib-like ridges on its back. Houndoom has a long, skinny tail with a triangular tip and three clawed toes on each paw. On top of its head is a pair of long, curved gray horns. These horns are smaller on the female than the male.

In a Houndoom pack, the one with its horns raked sharply towards the back serves a leadership role. Leadership is determined by fights within the pack. Its gut is full of toxins, which are used to create fire. This gives Houndoom's fire a foul odor and the wounds it inflicts will never heal. Houndoom appears near rough terrain areas. Its howling induces shivering in other Pokémon, and often sends them scurrying back to their nests.

As Mega Houndoom, the ridges on its back thicken, and it gains additional, bone-like rings around the base of its tail. The rings on its tail have small spikes on top, causing them to resemble vertebrae. The ridge at the base of Mega Houndoom's neck is longer and curves forward towards its shoulders. Instead of a band with a skull pendant, there is a large, toothed structure around its neck. This bone-like formation has two large spikes on either side and three pointed teeth on the bottom. Mega Houndoom's horns now point straight up with a small, outward curve in the middle. The two bands on its hind legs have vanished, and those on its forelegs are broken in the front. Its claws are a dark red due to its ability to generate more heat, which themselves cause pain to Mega Houndoom.[1] Finally, the tip of its tail is now split down the middle.

It has three claws on its feet and hands. A ring of spikes surrounds the tip of its tail.

Mega Tyranitar has more gaps in its armor than its normal form, with four new triangular holes along the sides of its neck and one on its throat. The four on its chest are now larger with the top two containing red ovals. While the spikes along the back of its neck grow shorter, the ones on its head elongate to form prominent ridges along its brows. The center spike on its head becomes a long, upright horn. Its chest plate expands, curving over its shoulders and along its back to form three long, irregular spikes on each side of its body. The scales on Mega Tyranitar's belly have now become red instead of blue and seethe with energy, enabling it to emanate more power.[1] It gains two sharp spikes on its knees, as well as more prominent leg joints. Its tail lengthens, with the three spikes surrounding its tip growing upward and outward. Its back had split open because of the overwhelming power from Mega Evolution.

Tyranitar is a powerful Pokémon with an insolent nature. It is extremely strong, and its thick, rocky hide gives it a good resistance to all forms of attack. Because of this, it is always looking for a battle and will not flinch at anything, though ignores opponents that it thinks are not worth its time. If enraged, Tyranitar sets off outstanding earthquakes that can completely change the entire landscape, destroying houses and mountains, often forcing cartographers to draw up new maps. It lives in nests made from demolished mountains. As a Mega Tyranitar, its instincts have only become more destructive, to the point where it may not even be able to hear its Trainer's orders.

If it were to flap its wings, it could hypothetically spawn storms lasting as long as 40 days. It is highly intelligent, and because of the devastating power it could accidentally inflict, it isolates itself deep underwater and tends to sleep in solitude. Lugia is the only known Pokémon that learns Aeroblast. It is extremely rare and is hardly ever seen.

Slaking lives in tropical forests, where it feeds on grass and ripened fruit that falls from trees. It only moves around when there is no more food within reach for it to eat.

It has pale blue, gemstone-like eyes, which allow it to see in low light and sparkle in the dark. It also has a red gemstone on its chest, and its back has a blue and green gemstone as well as another red one. These gem-like eyes and adornments on its body are caused by its diet, which consists of rocks and raw gemstones. It also targets Carbink as prey, though they are usually taken by Gabite before Sableye can reach them. It is feared by people, since it is said to steal a person's soul if they look into its eyes. It is nocturnal and is rarely seen. It lives in caves.

As Mega Sableye, all the energy from its Mega Evolution is concentrated into the red jewel on its chest, causing it to rip out of Sableye's skin and significantly increase in size; the detached jewel leaves a small hole in Mega Sableye's chest. Its ears elongate, and it gains a spike on the top of its head. Its teeth turn from white to yellow, and its eyes also change from pale blue to a crimson red, with diagonal slits at their inner edges.

Mega Sableye,302,Sableye is a Dark/Ghost type Pokémon introduced in Generation 3. It is known as the Darkness Pokémon.,"Sableye is a bipedal Pokémon with a dark purple body, armed with sharp teeth and claws, which it uses to dig through soil. It has pale blue, gemstone-like eyes, which allow it to see in low light and sparkle in the dark. It also has a red gemstone on its chest, and its back has a blue and green gemstone as well as another red one. These gem-like eyes and adornments on its body are caused by its diet, which consists of rocks and raw gemstones. It also targets Carbink as prey, though they are usually taken by Gabite before Sableye can reach them. It is feared by people, since it is said to steal a person's soul if they look into its eyes. It is nocturnal and is rarely seen. It lives in caves.

As Mega Sableye, all the energy from its Mega Evolution is concentrated into the red jewel on its chest, causing it to rip out of Sableye's skin and significantly increase in size; the detached jewel leaves a small hole in Mega Sableye's chest. Its ears elongate, and it gains a spike on the top of its head. Its teeth turn from white to yellow, and its eyes also change from pale blue to a crimson red, with diagonal slits at their inner edges. Its back gains more gems: a second green one, a second red one and two small yellow gems. The enlarged jewel is said to boast such incredible hardness that no attack can even leave a scratch on it. During battle, Mega Sableye shelters itself behind the jewel, from where it can take advantage of any openings its target leaves exposed.[1] However, being forced to support its massive jewel leaves Sableye unable to turn quickly, making it vulnerable from behind.

Mawile,303,Mawile is a Steel/Fairy type Pokémon introduced in Generation 3. It is known as the Deceiver Pokémon.,"Mawile is a short, bipedal Pokémon with a pale yellow body and black arms and feet. Its legs have a thick, fur-like covering resembling hakama or a skirt. Its most notable feature is a pair of large black jaws emerging from the back of its head. These jaws have an oval yellow spot on their top surface and contain ten pointed teeth - six on the top row and four on the bottom. While the jaws are said to actually be transformed steel horns, Mawile can articulate them at will, using them to bite enemies and chew through iron beams. These jaws are also incapable of tasting, and can be used by Mawile to eat food it does not like. It has red eyes and two black ear-like extensions on either side of its head.

Mega Mawile has a second set of jaws protruding from the back of its head, and both sets now have a spiky tuft of hair. It also seems to be able to control each jaw independently of each other.[1] The ear-like extensions on its head are longer and have tips with two points. The fur on its legs is now magenta, and it now has longer fur on its arms with magenta markings around its wrists.

Mawile is typically found in caves. It uses its non-threatening appearance to make foes underestimate it, then attacks with its giant jaws or swallows prey whole; when engaged in battle, Mawile usually has its back turned on the enemy to better use its jaws. Mega Mawile can use both its jaws to grip on prey and tear them apart. These jaws thrash around violently.

Aron,304,Aron is a Steel/Rock type Pokémon introduced in Generation 3. It is known as the Iron Armor Pokémon.,"Aron is a quadruped Pokémon with four stubby legs and a large round head. Its body is black with plates of gray armor covering its head, back, and legs. Throughout its body are small openings in the armor. There are six openings on its head, with the largest two being openings for its pale blue eyes, and one opening on either side of the spike on its back. A single, blunt spike protrudes from its back.

Aron feeds on iron ore that it digs from mountains. It uses this ore to make its body. Sometimes hunger will drive it to descend from the mountains to eat bridges and rails, which makes it a pest. It makes a new suit of armor after evolving, while its old discarded armor is salvaged for making iron products. With one all-out charge, it can demolish even a heavy dump truck. It lives on mountains.

Lairon smashes its steely body against others in battle over territory, and shows off its strength with the size of sparks it creates by ramming into rocks. It drinks nutritious mineral spring water and feeds on iron contained in rocks. It builds its nest on mountains where iron ore is buried, which results in it clashing with humans that are iron mining.

Its forehead plating extends past its upper jaw in a small point. It has sky-blue eyes, and two nostril-like holes on the tip of its upper jaw. On the rim of its mouth are several pointed, fang-like protrusions and the nape of its neck and back have gray-silver armor sections. It has wide, blunt spikes on its shoulders, and gray-silver bands on its arms and legs. Its hands and feet each have three claws. It has a thick, long, black tail that it can swing at enemies.

Mega Aggron is bulkier and more heavily plated than its previous state. The horns on its forehead are now shorter, and it has a third, wider horn on its nose. Using its horns, it is said to be able to destroy a steel tank.[1] A spike projects downward from both its upper and lower jaw. The protrusions on its shoulders are longer and curve toward its head, and new spikes thrust from holes in its armbands. Its tail is thicker with two bands around it.

The gouges in Aggron's armor from previous battles are worn as mementos. The more wounds it has, the more it has battled. It claims a large mountain as its territory and fiercely defends it from trespassers. If its environment is damaged by a flood or a forest fire, it will restore the area by bringing in topsoil and planting trees. It burrows through the strongest of bedrock and digs tunnels, as it searches for iron to eat. Its horns, which it uses to dig through bedrock when seeking food, grow a little longer at a time and can be used to determine its age.

There is now a gold band on each wrist and additional gold bands around its waist. Several blue, teardrop-shaped decorations hang from the lowest hip band. Using its enhanced willpower, Mega Medicham has formed four ghost-like arms around itself. The more trained its spirit, the more realistic and dexterous its self-created arms become.[1]

Through the power of meditation and fasting, Medicham has developed a sixth sense. This allows it to use psychokinetic powers, and it heightens its energy to enhance this sixth sense. It battles with elegant, dance-like movements, which it uses to dodge attacks and launch devastating blows. It only eats once per month. It lives in fields and mountains. It will hide itself by using its powers to blend into its surroundings.

Electrike,309,Electrike is an Electric type Pokémon introduced in Generation 3. It is known as the Lightning Pokémon.,"Electrike is a green, canine Pokémon with yellow markings. It has a large head crest with angular, lightning-like markings on the side. Its snout has a yellow blaze, and four fangs are discernible when its mouth is open. It has a yellow stripe down its back. Each of its four legs has a spike, with the ones on its hind legs being longer. It has yellow crescent-shaped paw pads on its front feet, while the pads on its hind feet are circular. It has a small, pointed, yellow-tipped tail.

Using the electric charge found in its fur, Electrike stimulates its leg muscles and runs faster than the human eye can follow. It uses friction from the atmosphere to generate electricity. Because of this, its body gives off showers of sparks in seasons with arid air or before a storm.

Manectric,310,Manectric is an Electric type Pokémon introduced in Generation 3. It is known as the Discharge Pokémon.,"Manectric is a canine, quadruped Pokémon. Its body is mainly blue with a spiky, yellow mane on its head and yellow tufts of fur on its haunches and around its front feet. Its mane sticks straight up and has three points. It has a jagged upper jaw, red eyes, and holes on either side of its head that seem to be its ears. Each of its paws has three claws. Its blue, spike-like tail is bent at a sharp angle.

The yellow mane on Mega Manectric is considerably larger than its previous state. The center spike on its head has shifted, and now forms a large, tilted growth that extends over its snout and has a point on either end. The remaining two head spikes are thinner, longer, and have small, pointed bulbs in place of the earholes. The mane now extends down the length of Mega Manectric's body, forming four additional spikes. One of these spikes extends down past the Pokémon's chest and has points on both ends. The tufts of fur on its haunches are now blue and form more numerous, thinner points. While it retains the yellow tufts around its front feet, they now have two short spikes extending backward. Finally, Mega Manectric lacks the sharply angled tail of its previous state and now has red claws.

Manectric gathers electricity its mane and then discharges it. This process creates thunderclouds, which it uses in battle. Since lightning falls in its vicinity, it is said to have been born from lightning and make its nest where lightning has struck. It lives in grasslands and savannas, and often appears in front of people.

A black pattern with two red, teardrop-shaped spots covered the center of its head and a yellow lower jaw. Three pairs of wing-like appendages extend from the sides of its long, thick neck. A plate of armor on its back has four short spikes and two triangular, yellow-rimmed wings extending from underneath. Its scaled chest and belly are rimmed with yellow lines as well, and there are two large yellow plates in the center of its chest. Its segmented arms extend from holes in these plates, each with a large, black claw. The legs are also segmented, with black knees. A pair of black fins tips its long tail.

In ancient times, Armaldo lived on land by the water's-edge, and dived into the ocean to hunt for prey. The large wings on its back were used for swimming, while its thick shell protected it from enemy attacks. Its strong claws can break stones and punch through a steel slab. Furthermore, they can be freely extended or retracted. It is considered to be the ancestor of some Bug-type Pokémon.

The tail and pectoral fins are dull blue and tattered in appearance. The dorsal fin is triangular with a hole in the middle. Due to its poor appearance, it is largely ignored by predators, Trainers, and researchers alike. However, this hardy Pokémon is capable of eating anything and living anywhere. It is often found in oceans and weed-choked ponds, even if only a little water is available. While there are many of this Pokémon in existence, populations tend to cluster in small areas. Once found, its dull wits make it easy to capture.

Kecleon is able to change the colors of its body at will, and is known for frequently using this ability to camouflage itself. However, it is unable to change the color of its red stripe.

By using camouflage to appear almost invisible, it can sneak up on prey and ensnare it with its long pink tongue. If unnoticed for too long though, it pouts and may never reveal itself. A purplish variant has been seen in the anime and the Pokémon Mystery Dungeon series; whether this is an example of it changing color or simply a different kind of Kecleon is unknown. This Pokémon lives in tropical and temperate forests.

It lives in garbage dumps and dark alleys, where it searches for the person that threw it away before it became a Pokémon.

Since it ate only this kind of fruit continuously, the fruit began to grow around its neck. These yellow, banana-like fruits can be picked and consumed by other Pokémon or humans, and grow twice a year because of the rapid production of sugar in Tropius's leaves. Its feet have toenails the same color as its fruit.

In warm areas, there are ranches that raise Tropius. In Alola, its fruit is especially sweet compared to those of other regions. It lives in tropical jungles.

Absol,359,Absol is a Dark type Pokémon introduced in Generation 3. It is known as the Disaster Pokémon.,"Absol is a quadruped, mammalian Pokémon with a dark blue to black body covered in white fur. It has a ruff around its neck and chest and a tuft on the top of its head adorned with a single blue-black oval. It has a feline face with almond-shaped, red eyes, a scythe-like tail, and a crescent shaped horn on the side of its head. Its broad feet are equipped with three claws each, and spikes protrude from the heels of its hind legs and the elbows of its front legs.

As Mega Absol, its fur is longer overall, and the increased energy coursing through its body makes the fur at the back of its mane stand on end, so that it appears to have wings.[1] The spikes on its heels and elbows grow larger, and the fur in these areas becomes longer as well. Its sickle-shaped horn widens, while an additional, smaller horn appears on the opposite side of its head. Its tail now has a more saw-like shape, and the oval marking on its forehead is now a rounded triangle.

Absol lives in the mountains far from civilization, and rarely ventures down from its alpine home. Using its horn, Absol is able to sense even subtle changes in the sky and the land to predict when a disaster will occur, and will try to warn people when one is approaching. This often has the unfortunate effect of Absol itself being blamed for the disaster, notably by the elderly. Mega Absol emits a fearsome aura that has been known to kill fainthearted people from shock. It directs this aura at its opponents by beating its ""wings"", which are not capable of flight. However, Absol apparently detests assuming this form, as it normally dislikes fighting in the first place.

Loving couples gave this Pokémon its name after spotting it in the ocean waters. It is primarily light pink, with pale lips and circular markings on its cheeks. During the spring, it forms groups that turn the ocean's surface bright pink. Luvdisc lives in warm seas, where it makes its nest in the branches of Corsola or coral reefs. As shown in Luvdisc is a Many Splendored Thing!, when two Luvdisc kiss, they are able to use their slender bodies as wings in order to fly for short periods of time.

Bagon,371,Bagon is a Dragon type Pokémon introduced in Generation 3. It is known as the Rock Head Pokémon.,"Bagon is a bipedal, blue, reptilian Pokémon vaguely resembling Pachycephalosaurus. It possesses a large, round snout, triangular eyes, yellow, circular ears similar to reptiles, and a yellow lower jaw with two teeth protruding upwards. Three thick, gray ridges cover the top of its head, and continue downwards to cover its neck as well. There is a triangular patch of yellow on its underside. It has stubby, digit-less arms and short legs with two toes on each foot.

Bagon lives in rough terrains with cliffs and rocks. It longs to fly and jumps off cliffs trying to be able to do so. Frustrated at its inability to fly, it leaps off cliffs and smashes its head against large rocks. This process of continually bashing its head causes it to become as hard as steel. Well-developed neck muscles support its hard head. This, combined with its powerful body, allows it to shatter rocks with its head.

There are bone structures covering its body, which form a shell with two openings and three ridges on top. One opening is in front, revealing two yellow eyes, while the other opening is in the back. This bony covering repels enemy attacks, but it makes Shelgon heavy. As a result, this Pokémon moves sluggishly and hardly eats. Inside the shell, its body is busy forming for its next evolution. The moment this Pokémon evolves, its shell peels away. Its gray legs are visible protruding from underneath the shell, each with a short red stripe on the inner surface. It can be found in caverns.

Salamence,373,Salamence is a Dragon/Flying type Pokémon introduced in Generation 3. It is known as the Dragon Pokémon.,"Salamence is a quadruped, draconic Pokémon with a long, tapering tail. It is primarily blue with a gray lower jaw and thickly scaled underside. There are red markings on its throat, the underside of its tail, and stripes on the inner surface of its legs. Additionally, there are raised red ridges above its eyes. Three flat fins protrude from either side of its head, possibly acting in the same manner that a Canard would on an aircraft. It has two pairs of pointed teeth, one in the upper jaw and one in the lower. Each of its short legs has three claws. This Pokémon's powerful desire to fly triggered a mutation that allowed it to grow large, red wings. As an expression of joy, it flies around and releases blasts of fire. If enraged, it loses all sense of self and flies into an uncontrollable rampage, destroying everything around it until it tires itself out. This Pokémon is found living in rough terrain.

As Mega Salamence, its wings meld together into a single huge, crescent-shaped wing. According to the anime, the hard, yet very flexible properties of its wings allow them to be used as blades in mid-air battles. Its face, neck, body and tail are narrower, and its tail is noticeably shorter in length. The ridges above its eyes are now far less prominent, and it no longer possesses the thick, gray scaling over its lower jaw. Instead, the smooth red flesh underneath has been left exposed, increasing its streamline appearance. The upper pair of fins resting on the sides of its head are now elongated and tapered. The lower pair has not changed much. However, the middle set now take the form of quarter-arches, spanning towards the bridge of the nose. The remnants of its shelled underbelly have been drastically transformed into a segmented, more aerodynamic, vest-like armored frame. This frame encases its chest and shoulders with the pieces interlocking whenever Mega Salamence tucks in its front forelegs.

The stress of Salamence's vaunted wings becoming misshapen in its Mega Evolution aggravates it to the point of rampaging. This fuels its already brutal nature and makes it likely to turn against the Trainer who raised it. Because of this, Mega Salamence is feared as ""the blood-soaked crescent"". Anything and anyone in Salamence's path gets sliced in two by its bladelike wings, posing no interruption to its flight.

It has one large, red eye in the center of its nearly spherical head, which is set into a ball-and-socket joint at its front end. A short crest projects from its body and extends over its head.

Even though Beldum is a mechanical creature, it still has emotions, the need to eat, and a way of reproducing. Beldum's body lacks blood, and is instead made of cells that are all magnets. It uses magnetism to move, communicate, and control its attacks. Beldum sometimes gathers in swarms, communicating with each other telepathically and magnetically and moving in sync. Beldum is scarce in the wild, but it does tend to inhabit areas with rugged terrain. It anchors itself to a cliff using its hooks when it sleeps.

Metang,375,Metang is a Steel/Psychic type Pokémon introduced in Generation 3. It is known as the Iron Claw Pokémon.,"Metang is a robotic Pokémon with teal, metallic skin. It has a disc-shaped body with a pair of flat, gray spikes on either side toward the rear. A jet cannot scratch Metang due to its strong body. There is a gray spike in the middle of its face, similar to a nose. A pair of red eyes reside in two holes in its metallic skin. While it appears to lack legs, it has a pair of thick arms with three claws on the ends. The arms are considerably thicker below the elbow and have a flat, blunt protrusion extending over the joint. It is able to rotate its arms backwards in order to travel at speeds over 60 mph (100 km/h), and its claws are able to rip through steel.

Metang is formed when two Beldum fuse together. A magnetic nervous system joins the brains of these two Pokémon. This linkage allows Metang to generate a strong, psychokinetic power, though it does not increase its intellect. This Pokémon's high intelligence and strong magnetic field are other sources of powerful psychic energy. In addition to generating psychic power, its magnetism allows Metang to hover in midair. This Pokémon lives on rough terrains. It pursues Nosepass, loving its magnetic minerals.

It is known as the Iron Leg Pokémon.,"Metagross is a massive, robotic Pokémon with a turquoise, disc-shaped body and four legs. The main body appears to serve as both head and body, and this Pokémon's overall construction gives it the appearance of a mechanized arachnid. It uses its heavy body to pin down its prey before consuming them with its large mouth. A large, metallic cross is situated in the center of its face. On either side of the cross, a red eye peers out from a space in Metagross's metallic armor. Its four legs are joined to the main body by ball-and-socket joints. While the upper portion of the legs is relatively thin, they are considerably thicker below the knee. Each leg has three short claws on the end and a flat, blunt protrusion extending over the knee. The legs can be tucked in, allowing Metagross to float in the air.

As Mega Metagross, it constantly floats, and its legs become arms. It also gains four legs on the back of its head. The cross on its face turns pale gold, and it gains two small holes and a spike immediately below the cross, giving the impression of a goatee. Its multiple brains process information simultaneously, enabling it to calmly assess the tide of a battle and defeat its opponent with accuracy. Mega Metagross also uses the psychic power inside its body to launch powerful attacks. Its claws are hard as steel and can easily smash even large chunks of rocks.

Metagross is the result of two Metang fusing together. This gives Metagross four brains in total, all connected by a complex network of neurons. Because of these complex connections and the number of brains, this Pokémon is capable of performing complex calculations and is more intelligent than a supercomputer. It uses its intelligence to analyze its opponents during battle. This Pokémon can be found on rough terrains. Mega Metagross achieves its form by linking up a Metagross, a Metang, and two Beldum together. During Mega Evolution, Metagross becomes a ruthless Pokémon that will use any means to win in battle, being downright cruel at some points. If it knows it cannot win, Mega Metagross digs its claws into opponent and prepares to explode.

Latias,380,Latias is a Dragon/Psychic type Pokémon introduced in Generation 3. It is known as the Eon Pokémon.,"Latias is a Pokémon with a bird-like body stylized after a plane. Its long neck stretches forward from its squat body. It has no legs, usually floating instead. The rear half of its body is largely red and the upper half white, with jet-plane wings high on its rear and fins on the bottom near its tail. A blue triangle marks the center of its chest, while a red mask partially covers its face. Ear-like fins sit on top of its head and its eyes are yellow. It has short, three-fingered arms with a red covering on the outer side of the lower arms. Latias is a female only species, with Latios being its male counterpart.

As Mega Latias, the red parts of its body change to purple. Horns grow from the side of its head and run along its jaw. It loses the wings on its back and similar but larger wings attach to its lower arms, normally held in a level position. Triangle shapes now mark the forward point of its wings instead of its chest.

Latias ruffles its feathers and cries loudly when there is hostility toward it. Its glass-like, downy feathers can enfold its body and refract light, which allows it to become invisible or alter its appearance. It can also use its down to use its signature move, Mist Ball. It is highly intelligent and can understand human speech. It is capable of using telepathy to communicate with others.

Mega Latias,380,Latias is a Dragon/Psychic type Pokémon introduced in Generation 3. It is known as the Eon Pokémon.,"Latias is a Pokémon with a bird-like body stylized after a plane. Its long neck stretches forward from its squat body. It has no legs, usually floating instead. The rear half of its body is largely red and the upper half white, with jet-plane wings high on its rear and fins on the bottom near its tail. A blue triangle marks the center of its chest, while a red mask partially covers its face. Ear-like fins sit on top of its head and its eyes are yellow. It has short, three-fingered arms with a red covering on the outer side of the lower arms. Latias is a female only species, with Latios being its male counterpart.

As Mega Latias, the red parts of its body change to purple. Horns grow from the side of its head and run along its jaw. It loses the wings on its back and similar but larger wings attach to its lower arms, normally held in a level position. Triangle shapes now mark the forward point of its wings instead of its chest.

Latias ruffles its feathers and cries loudly when there is hostility toward it. Its glass-like, downy feathers can enfold its body and refract light, which allows it to become invisible or alter its appearance. It can also use its down to use its signature move, Mist Ball. It is highly intelligent and can understand human speech. It is capable of using telepathy to communicate with others. In the fifth movie, Latias had the ability ""Sight Sharing"", which allowed Latias and people around it to see exactly what Latios was seeing. It normally does not make contact with humans or other Pokémon, and disappears when an enemy is nearby. It forms herds with several members, and is usually found near water.

Kyogre,382,Kyogre is a Water type Pokémon introduced in Generation 3. It is known as the Sea Basin Pokémon.,"Kyogre is a massive whale-like Pokémon with two big pectoral fins, each with four white square-shaped nails. It has a deep blue body and a white chin area with two small spikes protruding under it. Above each eye are two white, oval-shaped spots. It has red stripes around its chin, eyes, dorsal fins, and torso. These stripes glow when Kyogre is brimming with power. The tail is tattered with four trailing parts, the inner ones being smaller than the outer. Its eyes are small, yellow, and shadowed with black.

Primal Kyogre retains its general body structure, but grows to more than double the size of its base form. Its main skin color becomes a darker shade of blue, the red markings along its body become light blue, and its eyes glow yellow with orange irises and orange-red pupils. The markings on its pectoral fins slightly change to form α symbols, which connect to its outer nails with red markings connecting the inner nails. Every part of its skin that was white in its base form becomes clear and translucent, with the large ovals on its head now connected to clear markings stretching from its tail to its forehead, where another α symbol is formed. The trailing parts of its tail grow longer and gain translucent webbing, and the areas between its pectoral fin markings also become clear. The translucent parts of its body reveal organ-like structures that glow with a mysterious light; it has a large ""organ"" at the center of its body, two smaller ones aligned with the large oval markings, and two more located in its pectoral fins. In the anime, Primal Kyogre is said to have widened the seas by a large margin simply by taking a swim.

Kyogre is said to be a powerful Pokémon, having control over the element of water and rain. It is said to have expanded the seas, and is hailed as a savior for quenching areas of the world plagued with drought. Kyogre is normally calm and peaceful, but if it meets its rival, Groudon, Kyogre will engage in a cataclysmic battle against it. In the Mystery Dungeon series and core series, Kyogre is able to fly. Kyogre generally lives deep in the ocean, and is said to rest in a deep trench. Kyogre is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Origin Pulse.

Groudon,383,Groudon is a Ground type Pokémon introduced in Generation 3. It is known as the Continent Pokémon.,"Groudon is a massive, bipedal, dinosaur-like creature covered in red, segmented plates of thick skin that act as armor. It has a gray underside and large white spikes that run along the sides of its head, body, and tail. It has four claws on each hand, four dozer-like blades on the end of its large tail, and three claws on each foot with gray markings under its feet. It also has blue stripes inside the seams of its armor plating which can only be seen when Groudon is glowing with power.

As Primal Groudon, its appearance is similar to Groudon, but larger in size. Its skin color changes from dark red to deep crimson with its underside, spikes, and teeth turning black. The blades on its tail are more separated from one another. The Ω symbol is now shown on its arms. Its eyes, the inside of its mouth, and the now-enlarged openings between its armor plating glow bright yellow, and its irises are now red. The energy that fills Primal Groudon pours forth as magma, and it burns with such an extreme temperature that its body is always shimmering with the haze of its heat.[1] In the anime, Primal Groudon is said to create new land with every step it takes.

Groudon is an immensely powerful Pokémon, having the ability to summon intense droughts and cause volcanic eruptions. The droughts it can cause allow it to evaporate water, while the volcanic eruptions it can summon enable it to create land. It sleeps underground in large magma chambers. If it encounters its rival, Kyogre, they will engage in a cataclysmic battle. Groudon is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Precipice Blades.

Rayquaza,384,Rayquaza is a Dragon/Flying type Pokémon introduced in Generation 3. It is known as the Sky High Pokémon.,"Rayquaza is a large, green, serpentine creature. It has red-tipped, rudder-like wings on its shoulders and down its body, and similarly patterned fins on the tip of its tail. Yellow ring-like symbols run across the length of Rayquaza's body and it has an additional yellow ring on top of its head. Rayquaza has two limbs with three-clawed hands, and two long, flat, horn-like structures on its head, with two shorter horns along its jawline. It has small, yellow eyes with black pupils, prominent pink gums, and two discernible fangs in its upper jaw.

As Mega Rayquaza, its body becomes longer and gains more features. Its head becomes longer with the Δ symbol appearing on its forehead. Its eyes now contain yellow pupils and red irises, and black, tree-like markings trail behind its eyes. Its red lips and teeth become gold, and the gold lines connect to those on its lower horns, which take on a broad, triangular shape. At the outer edges of its lower horns are long, golden, glowing tendrils that each extend to a green, fin-like structure; these tendrils have ring patterns that strongly resemble the yellow markings running along the length of Rayquaza's normal form. Its two upper horns become longer with a gold line running over them in a V shape, and each upper horn has another glowing tendril that ends in a circular shape with a spike. Along the length of its body are golden, glowing orbs placed where its ring patterns used to be. The chin, part of the neck, and parts of its serpentine body are changed to the color black. The fins running along its body are now marked with gold lines; the fins on its tail become entirely yellow and substantially longer. Particles stream from the long tendrils that extend from its jutting jaw; these particles can control the density and humidity of the air, allowing Mega Rayquaza to manipulate the weather. Its green hide sparkles with an emerald-like quality.[1]

Inside Rayquaza's body lies an organ that contains the same power as a Mega Stone. A Devon Corporation scientist named this organ the mikado organ (Japanese: ミカド器官). By consuming meteoroids as it flies through the stratosphere, the mikado organ will be filled with enough energy to enable Rayquaza's Mega Evolution.

It is able to soothe the other members of the weather trio, even in their Primal Forms. Rayquaza is said to have lived for hundreds of millions of years in the ozone layer, where it feeds on water and other particles. Rayquaza is rarely seen by people; even in flight, its appearance is indistinguishable from that of a meteor. Rayquaza preys on the Minior in the Alola region.

On its belly is a curved seam, which conceals a third eye, known as its ""true"" eye. Additionally, it has a normal pair of circular eyes on its face, with small, blue triangular markings underneath. On its head is a large, yellow structure with three points extending outward: one from the top and one on either side. On each point is a teal tag, known as a ""wish tag"". A rounded extension hangs from either side of the yellow structure, framing Jirachi's face. Two yellow streamers flow from this Pokémon's back, resembling comet tails.

Jirachi hibernates for extensive periods, forming a protective crystalline shell as it sleeps. However, it is still capable of fighting while asleep if it is in danger. It awakens for seven days every thousand years, but can also waken if sung to by a voice of purity. During the short periods when it is awake, Jirachi is said to grant wishes. However, in the anime, Jirachi cannot create an object that is desired from a wish. Instead, it teleports the desired object to the person that made the wish. In the Pokémon Adventures manga, Jirachi's wishes are granted by writing on the three tags located on its head. Due to only having three tags, Jirachi can only grant three wishes. The anime further reveals that Jirachi's awakening is linked to the Millennium Comet and that its third eye has the ability to absorb the energy Jirachi needs for hibernation. Although it is extremely rare, Jirachi can be found in the mountains. Jirachi is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Doom Desire.

Normal Forme,386,Deoxys is a Psychic type Pokémon introduced in Generation 3. It is known as the DNA Pokémon.,"Deoxys is an alien-like bipedal Pokémon that has four Formes, each focused on a different stat. The main components that are constant for all four Formes are a dominant reddish orange color, a bluish-green face, and three bluish-green dots on its back arranged in a triangle. Typically, there is a purple stripe running down the center of its face and a purple, crystalline organ in its chest. Its white, circular eyes are set inside rectangular, black eye sockets. It is shown in the anime, that Deoxys may have a green crystalline organ and facial stripe.

In its Normal Forme, Deoxys has tapering legs with a segmented, vertical, blue stripe on the upper portion. The abdomen is black with vertical lines, while the majority of its skin is reddish-orange. The arms are capable of taking different forms, usually a pair of tentacles coiled in a double helix. One tentacle is the primarily skin color, while the other is light blue. Alternately, it can form more humanoid arms with a red top and blue underside and a five-fingered hand. This Forme has a blunt protrusion with a single blue stripe on either side of its head and stubby tail.

While in its Attack Forme, its legs remain tapered. However, its blue stripes are no longer segmented and run the entire length of the leg and there is now a large spike on the knee. Two pairs of whip-like tentacles with pointed tips, one reddish-orange and one blue, replace its previous coiled, blunted tentacles. The protrusions on its head are now triangular with an additional one extending from the top of its head. Most of its reddish-orange skin has receded, revealing a striated, black chest and abdomen. Finally, its tail is now longer and more pointed.

Deoxys's Defense Forme has bulky, wide legs that are somewhat flat at the end with a bluish-green spot on each knee. It retains its two pairs of red and blue tentacles, but they are now flat and broad. The head has fused with its body and all protrusions are gone, causing it to resemble a helmet. The reddish-orange skin now covers the entire body, so none of its inner black portion is visible. There is now a single blue stripe on each shoulder, and its tail has disappeared.

The Speed Forme of this Pokémon has a sleek black body with thin striation. The reddish-orange skin now covers only its head, hip joints, and the area around its crystal. There is now only one tentacle on each side of its body, one red and one blue. The protrusions on its head now point upward and the back of its head now forms a long spike. There is a long, thick blue stripe running down the center of this longer protrusion. More blue stripes appear on either hip joint and on its legs.

Deoxys was formed by the mutation of a virus from space. The Pokémon is highly intelligent; its brain appears to be the crystal in its chest. This organ is capable of firing laser beams. Additionally, Deoxys can use psychokinetic powers, which are useful for its signature move Psycho Boost. As shown in the anime, it is able to regenerate any part of its body that it may have lost during a battle. It has also demonstrated the ability to create an aurora without changing its Forme. These auroras can have different electromagnetic wavelengths and are used to communicate with other Deoxys. It is also shown that the various electromagnetic waves given off by people, Pokémon, and all electronics can obscure its vision if there is enough interference with its communication. This Pokémon came from outer space from inside of a meteor.

In the anime and manga, Deoxys has been observed to create clones of itself. These clones have lifeless eyes and duller color, lack of the trademark crystal on the chest, and seem to be unable to change from the Normal Forme. Furthermore, they seem unable to morph their tentacles into hands. When these clones are defeated, they dissolve into dust-like particles.

It has a hooked beak, red irises, and a hard, blue, dome-shaped head with four spikes on its back. It has stubby arms with three claws; despite the stubbiness, it can attack with them. The back half of its body has a large, spiky pattern of blue and it has a short tail. It has feet with three forward claws and one backward.

Its main attacking prowess involves charging head-first into its opponents. When it lived in dense forests and jungles 100 million years ago, it would use headbutts to snap obstructing trees, down its prey, and combat other Pokémon like Aerodactyl. It notably lacks any intelligence.

Rampardos,409,Rampardos is a Rock type Pokémon introduced in Generation 4. It is known as the Head Butt Pokémon.,"Rampardos is a large, dark-gray dinosaur-like Pokémon resembling a Pachycephalosaurus. It has a dome head, which obstructs its red eyes. It has blue stripes, one on its tail and one on each of its knees and wrists. It has various spikes: one on each knee, two on its blue collar on its neck, two short ones on its nose, and four on its head. Two of these head spikes are bigger than the other two.

Its strength lies within its fierce head-butting attacks. A charging Rampardos can knock down virtually anything with one hit. 100 million years ago, it lived in jungles, where it tore down jungle trees while catching prey. It enjoys barging into objects with its head to train its strength and reflexes. This resulted in its skull becoming harder than steel and a foot thick, which prevents it from fainting if it crashes into anything, even another charging Rampardos. In ancient times, people would dig up its well-developed skull fossil and use it as a helmet. However, because its skull became so thick, its brain also became even smaller than that of Cranidos, lending credence to the theory that its stupidity led to its extinction.

Its facial hide is extremely hard; however, it is vulnerable when attacked from behind.

100 million years ago, Shieldon lived in dense forests. It has a habit of polishing its face against tree trunks. It is speculated that few enemies would have considered challenging its armored face. It eats grass, tree roots, and Berries. Its fossils show no sign of damage to its face.

Bastiodon,411,Bastiodon is a Rock/Steel type Pokémon introduced in Generation 4. It is known as the Shield Pokémon.,"Bastiodon appears to be a cross between a Zuniceratops and a bulldozer. Its dark gray, square head resembles a castle wall, complete with four cream yellow, window-like spots with a black outline, three dark gray spikes on the top, and two larger gray spikes in the upper corners. Bastiodon's triangular nose extends from the middle of its shield-like head down over its lips and appears to be pierced by a gray, horizontal spike. Four spikes jut downward and four large, blunt tusks protrude upward from its dark gray lower jaw. Bastiodon's cream yellow eyes are partially obscured by the nasal spike and spaced-out tusks. Its thick, cream yellow body is further protected by a gray ridge and dark gray plates on its back, jagged growths on its legs, and a plated tail.

It is from roughly 100 million years ago. Despite its rough, intimidating appearance, Bastiodon is actually a docile, caring Pokémon that feeds on grass and Berries. Its steel-hard, shield-like face is capable of repelling any attack. When multiple Bastiodon line up, their faces form a wall that nothing can break through; this was how they protected their young. In stark contrast to its impenetrable frontal defense, it is vulnerable from behind. It seems to have lived in the same habitats as Rampardos, as evidenced by their fossils often being found together.

Burmy has six stubby legs: the first two pairs are black, while the back pair is yellow. There are two white spots on its cheeks, but they are only visible on a Burmy without a cloak. A coat of leaves, sand and gravel, or pink building insulation normally covers Burmy's body. It will not hesitate to collect nearby materials to construct a new cloak if the old one breaks or falls off. Even if it is born where there are no cocooning materials, it somehow always ends up with a cloak. The cloak protects it from the cold, and will become thinner when the weather is hot.

The top two hexagons have a single antenna and a wing connected to an orange-colored joint. A female Combee has a red spot on the forehead of its lower face.

Combee can fly with its two wings as long as the top two ""bees"" co-ordinate their flapping. It is mostly sociable among their own kind. It is generally harmless; it flees when threatened. A Combee will almost always be found collecting honey wherever they can. The gathered honey has multiple purposes, though it's usually consumed. When it is not gathering honey, it sleeps or protects its queen. The former is done by creating a hive along with other Combee, locking together into a ""wall"" to feel safe in larger numbers. It is very suggestible and will never defy the orders of its queen. When a Vespiquen feels threatened, its subject Combee will not think twice about risking its life to protect the queen, then attacking and even killing the threat in an aggressive manner.

Underneath the expansive abdomen are honeycomb-like cells that serve as a nest for baby Combee. However, it appears to have a slender, more insect-like abdomen in the centermost cell, which is inconspicuous as the ‘dress’ usually obstructs the view of it. Vespiquen has black, skinny arms with two orange claws and flies with a pair of relatively small wings on its back. Its yellow upper body is a nearly perfect sphere and its waist is black and slender. A curved line on its back between its shoulders separates its thorax and waist. Vespiquen's orange face has intimidating red eyes, oversized, yellow, protruding mandibles, and a red gem on its forehead. The top portion of its head is similar to a headpiece with yellow and black horn-like projections, resembling a hairstyle historically favored by early medieval-period English queens. Vespiquen is a female-only species.

Vespiquen is a queen of a hive of Combee, controlling it and protecting it, as well as giving birth to young Combee. A Vespiquen is far more powerful than its followers, and will only take action if its Combee are unable to protect the hive. If outsiders prove themselves to it by defending its hive, it may repay these acts of kindness with a reward. It feeds on flowers to make honey. It then uses it to bring up other Combee. Being a queen, it can command other Combee in order to use Attack Order, Defend Order, and Heal Order, her signature moves.

It is known as the EleSquirrel Pokémon.,"Pachirisu is a small, white squirrel-like Pokémon with a faint blueish tint and a light blue stripe starting from its forehead and goes all the way down to the tip of the tail. A female Pachirisu's blue stripe is shorter than a male's. A large white tooth grows out of its mouth. It has deep gray eyes and a yellow circle on each cheek. Its tail is almost twice as big as its body, with three spikes at the top of the curl, which it can use to shoot charges. Though its arms and legs are very short, it can run incredibly fast, enabling it to tire pursuing Pokémon out quickly. It has a great amount of electricity flowing in its body. If it builds up enough charge, it may shock other Pokémon.

When it sleeps, Pachirisu likes to curl its big, fluffy tail round to the front of its body and uses it as a pillow. It also likes to chase and groom its tail. When a Pachirisu sheds its fur it shapes them into furballs, which have static charges just like its fur. It hides its favorite foods—which mainly consist of berries—in these static puffs and stores them in tree holes. It does this to protect the food; if a human or another Pokémon tries to take the food, they will get shocked from the static. It may rub cheek pouches with another Pachirisu to share stored electricity. It is generally found in tree tops in forests, as well as the outskirts of a forest and near power plants.

The underside of its face and stomach are also cream-colored, as are the tips of its two tails. A male Buizel has two cream-colored spots on their back, while a female has only one.

Buizel's yellow collar is a flotation sac that can be inflated when it inhales. By doing so, Buizel can keep its face above water to watch for prey movement or survey its surroundings.

Floatzel,419,Floatzel is a Water type Pokémon introduced in Generation 4. It is known as the Sea Weasel Pokémon.,"Floatzel is an orange Pokémon resembling an anthropomorphic otter or weasel with longer arms than legs. It has four fingers on each hand and three toes on each foot. Its feet are small in comparison to the rest of the body. It has two pointed blue fins on its arms, two aligned, backward-swept, pointed fins on its head, and two tails. The yellow flotation device, which seems to be made of rubber or a similar substance, gives the impression of an inflatable life vest. The flotation sac goes in a kind of ring behind its head, down in front of its arms, then back behind its back above the tails. When it lays on its back, the flotation sac could also be interpreted as a sort of inflatable dinghy using its tails as a propeller and its fins as oars. Its tails can infinitely spin around like propeller blades. Its forelimbs and tails are tipped in cream, and there is an orange teardrop shape near the bottom of its cream belly.

Floatzel also has a circular cream spot in the center of its head, cream eyelids and a pattern of two black triangles on the edges of its cream muzzle. It has one cream, slightly protruding, oval-shaped spot on its back if it is female and two if it is male. It has small, sharp canine teeth, the top two of which can be seen when its mouth is closed. It can use its swimming capabilities to assist in the rescues of drowning people. To help it dive, Floatzel can deflate its flotation sac, and then inflate it once again when it wishes to surface. It is a fresh water Pokémon and tends to inhabit swift-moving rivers. Some believe Floatzel is a fish-eater.

Cherubi,420,Cherubi is a Grass type Pokémon introduced in Generation 4. It is known as the Cherry Pokémon.,"Cherubi is a small cherry-like Pokémon with a round, deep-pink body with two stubby feet. It has beady eyes and a purple-red stripe running down part of its face. Cherubi has a short stem with two big, green leaves and a second, much smaller head growing out of it. This second head is vestigial in terms of function, but it contains nutrients that contribute to Cherubi's growth as its initial source of food. As the second head is apparently edible, several Pokémon have been seen trying to pluck it off. When the second head begins to bloom it means Cherubi is close to evolving. It has been known to sun bathe on warm days. When it is about to evolve, the second head starts to wilt. Cherubi mainly photosynthesizes, and it is attracted to honey. Starly is a natural predator of Cherubi.

When there is strong sunlight, Cherrim is in its Sunshine Form. Pink petals similar to cherry blossoms surround its head and cover its chest. Several of the petals radiate outward from a yellow sphere on the back of its head. There is a small, triangular patch of green on its neck. Additionally, two berry-like orbs, resembling cherry-shaped hair ornaments, adorn its head. It has stubby limbs, with the arms being pink and the legs being yellow.

Cherrim waits quietly as a bud for a ray of sunlight. When it is hit with strong sunlight, it blooms and absorbs the rays with its entire body. It quickly changes from quiet to excitable and active. It will attempt to make up for everything it had to endure as a bud while the sunlight lasts. Once the light is gone, Cherrim folds back into a bud.

However, both forms have a shell-like back and an amorphous lower body. Both forms also have yellow lining around their eyes, mouth, and back.

In the West Sea form, the underside is white and its shell is pink. The shell has several small spike-like protrusions on it. On its head is a ring of pink fleshy knobs resembling flower petals that spike up.

In the East Sea form, the underside is green and its shell is blue. The shell has two flap-like protrusions. These flaps are lined in yellow. On its head are two white-tipped knobs resembling horns that extend away from its face.

The Nurse Joy featured in Gateway to Ruin! revealed Mt. Coronet's formation led to the allopatric speciation event, with the original population of Shellos being separated into two. As a result, Shellos' color and other physical differences began to vary due to environmental differences and population isolation over time. The two forms are still able to interbreed; the child takes the mother's form or the father's if bred with a Ditto. If it is pushed or squeezed, a mysterious purple fluid will ooze out of its body. In the anime, West Sea Shellos can extend their necks to incredible lengths. It is unknown if the East Sea form can do this as well. Shellos live along the sea shore.

In its East Sea form, it retains the horns it had as a Shellos, although now fully colored green which point at a 45 degree angle. Its underside up to the bottom of its mouth is blue, its back and the top of its head is completely green, and it has two yellow ""fins"" adorned on its back with a third bordering its side and rear, as well as two small blue spots between them.

The eyes are intense, with black sclerae and gold-colored irises.

When Garchomp Mega Evolves, it grows in size and several of its features become more angular, including its head and shoulders. A row of five tooth-like spikes sprouts from each side of its abdomen, and red spikes grow from its knees. The claws and fins on its arms melt from the excessive Mega Evolution energy and morph together to form sharp, red blades. Because Garchomp takes great pride in its winglike fins, the sight of them melting into scythes sends it mad with rage. Its scythes can slice the ground to pieces, and Mega Garchomp viciously tears up its opponents with them.

Garchomp can fly at an incredible speed to catch its prey. It preys on bird Pokémon, and is known to eat entire flocks of them whole. It sometimes battles Salamence in the air as they compete for food. The fine scales on its body reduce drag for easier flight, and their sharp edges also serve to injure opponents who attack it directly. Garchomp is a cave-dweller and is seldom seen in the wild.

People call Mega Lucario's fighting style heartless due to it being bathed in combative instincts and not showing any mercy to any other opposing Pokémon.

Lucario is considered to be prideful, and is extremely loyal to its Trainer. It also seems to have a natural sense of justice. It usually lives deep in mountains very far from people to improve their skills. It is an exceptionally rare Pokémon. Lucario are primarily carnivores, hunting their prey in packs, though one Lucario was seen eating Berries and plants, like roses. It has been seen eating chocolate, even though chocolate is not part of its natural diet.

Magnezone,462,Magnezone is an Electric/Steel type Pokémon introduced in Generation 4.

Magnezone's body is wide and circular, similar to a disc or saucer, with a thin edge circling the diameter of its body. Its main eye is in the center, containing a large, red pupil. On each side of its body, it has a ball shaped addition, with each side containing an eye, horseshoe magnet, and Phillips head screw. These secondary eyes can move independently of its main eye, as shown in Confronting the Darkness! On top of its head is a tall, thin, yellow rod, closely resembling an antenna, which it uses for certain attacks. Behind its body is a third horseshoe magnet, positioned like a tail.

As seen in Giratina and the Sky Warrior and Phantom Thief Pokémon 7, Magnezone's anti-gravity is strong enough to carry humans with ease.

It flies through the night sky, often mistaken for a UFO sighting, though it seems to be receiving and sending signals from an unknown source and an unknown purpose. This leads some people to believe that Magnezone came from outer space.

Gliscor,472,Gliscor is a Ground/Flying type Pokémon introduced in Generation 4. It is known as the Fang Scorp Pokémon.,"Gliscor is a large, mainly blue-purple vampire bat-like Pokémon. Its legs have two toes and a slightly darker circular coloration on the underside, and its tail has two barbs, giving its tail the resemblance of a vampire's fangs.

Its ears have discernible, red, chambered ear insides, and its eyes are yellow. It has six visible fangs in its mouth, and its waist, like its arms, is red and striated. Gliscor's body resembles an open mouth, with the pointed protrusions coming from its upper torso resembling fangs, further illustrating its vampiric qualities.

As shown in Riding the Winds of Change!, Gliscor, along with its unevolved form Gligar, can emit a sort of sound wave in order to detect obstacles and fly around them, similar to echolocation. Its legs appear to be not suitable for walking, so it can only perform short hops when on the ground. Gliscor hangs upside down while sleeping, much like other bat-like Pokémon, and it is nocturnal. It is capable of soundless flight; however, its wings cannot be flapped to the same extent that other Pokémon's wings can. Like Jumpluff and Wingull, Gliscor uses winds and updrafts to glide from place to place. When there is no wind, Gliscor climbs to the top of tall trees using its sharp raptorial claws and then glides from place to place. This practice is similar to flying squirrels. It is extremely rare, but sometimes it is found in thick pine forests and swamps.

Porygon-Z was given additional software in order to increase its abilities. The initial idea was to give it the ability to travel through alien dimensions, though it did not work as planned. Instead, the Pokémon began acting erratically. This has been attributed to the incompetence of the engineer who faultily updated its programming. Porygon-Z and its pre-evolutions are the only known Pokémon that can learn Conversion and Conversion 2.

It also has a red spiky growth around its neck. It has skinny arms and long black tatters hanging from its shoulders. It also has black, claw-like hands. It has the slight appearance of an hourglass figure and appears to be wearing an old, ripped cloak. It normally does not have any sort of legs, but it is able to extend stilt-like appendages in their place. In self-defense, Darkrai can retract its head and white ""plume"" into the pit atop its torso fringed by the aforementioned red growth.

Darkrai is known to ""inhabit"" dreams and causes the target to have unending nightmares, which can be stopped if exposed to a Lunar Wing from Cresselia. However, the ""unleashing of nightmares"" is actually a defense mechanism, instead of an intentionally malicious act. It can become a shadow and escape danger or contact with humans. It is also capable of some human speech. In The Rise of Darkrai, it was shown its power was weaker than that of Dialga and Palkia. As seen in an anime episode, Darkrai does not only cause nightmares; it is also attracted to them. It can also go around objects it is attracted to several times, as seen in the mentioned episode and Pokémon Ranger: Shadows of Almia. Darkrai possibly feeds off dreams, characterized by its association with never-ending nightmares. Darkrai is the only known Pokémon that learns Dark Void.

Shaymin is the smallest Mythical Pokémon to date.

In Sky Forme, it has a slender, canine appearance like that of a small reindeer.

Each season, Shaymin gathers with others in a flower field somewhere and migrates from there. This behavior is called Flower Carrying because a new field of flowers grow where it lands. Shaymin is also attracted to areas where there is a lot of gratitude. Its personality is almost opposite with each form: in Land Forme, it is shy and easily scared, while in Sky Forme, it is courageous and playful.

Arceus is thought to have created the Sinnoh region and possibly the entire Pokémon world, the lake guardians Uxie, Azelf, and Mesprit; and the creation trio Dialga, Palkia, and Giratina. Because of this, Arceus is thought to be one of the most long-lived of all Pokémon species. It has the power to recreate the creation trio as well, presumably to guard the dimensions when a Trainer has caught one of them. According to the anime, its power can also bring back things that it once destroyed, make certain things vanish into thin air, or to halt time.

Arceus is shown to care for and safeguard the planet in ancient times and protected it from cataclysms such as meteors, and it would show gratitude and compassion in return to those who treated it with equal kindness. Arceus does not suffer fools gladly, and it will attack in a violent rampage if betrayed or deceived. It also holds long grudges if betrayed by those it considered friends. In Arceus and the Jewel of Life, it is said to ""feed"" off the energy of the elemental plates. It is the only known Pokémon that can learn Judgment.

The arms have spiky extensions of fur at the elbows, and it has red claws on its hands and feet. Zoroark's eyes are red-rimmed with light blue irises.

Zoroark can create illusions that are indistinguishable from reality, deluding many people simultaneously. It can even create illusory landscapes in the forests where it dwells, to hide its territory and protect its den. However, Zoroark is incapable of physically changing itself into another form; it is merely capable of casting illusions. When a Zoroark takes the form of a human, it is capable of human speech. It can make convincing illusions of attacks, and these illusions are extremely realistic, enough to fool even cameras and make one believe they're being physically affected, though the illusion does not have any direct physical effect.

Zoroark lives in groups, where unity is strong. It is extremely protective of those it cares about and will go to any lengths to keep them safe, including risking its own life, and it can hold grudges on those who harm its loved ones. Zoroark will hide its Zorua young in its mane to protect them and carry them around. There are stories that say Zoroark punishes those who attempt to catch it by trapping them in an illusion.

The two smaller simple eyes are situated between the first pair, slightly higher up on its face. Joltik's mandibles point downward and reside at the bottom of its face, where they closely resemble tufts of hair.

Joltik is too small to generate its own electricity, so it attaches itself to larger Pokémon and feeds off their static electricity. It will also make its way into houses and feed off electricity in electrical sockets. All of the energy it absorbs it stores in an electric pouch on its body. As seen in the anime, Joltik is not especially aggressive, but will defend itself if bothered. It has been demonstrated that if Joltik is unable to find a source of energy, it will be unable to move and in serious danger.

Each leg is connected to the head by a blue upper half. The lower half is covered in yellow fur and forms a bell-shape over its blue, conical feet.

Galvantula, and its pre-evolution Joltik, are the only Pokémon that can learn Electroweb by leveling up. Galvantula in particular likes to use electrically charged silk to ensnare prey. The electricity stuns the victim, allowing Galvantula to consume the target at its leisure. Its pedipalps are very strong, allowing Galvantula to hold down unruly prey. It also uses electric webs to defend itself from threats. As seen in the anime, Galvantula is not particularly aggressive unless provoked. If bothered, it may attack in groups.

Reshiram's face is fringed with spiky features, and it has a small, pointed extension below the chin. Its eyes have blue irises and black pupils. There are two pairs of pointed teeth visible when its mouth is open, one in the upper jaw and one in the lower.

Reshiram has a long and slender neck, with a fluffy, collar-like protrusion jutting out of two gray, glass-like neck-bands. Its arms begin slender and arm-like, but then flare out into a more wing-like appearance, sporting four claws which resemble hands on the leading edge. There are plates at the back of Reshiram's ""hands"", that sport a similar color to its neck rings. Reshiram has a feathered or furry feature on its chest, with the lower portion protruding outwards to a point. Long feather-like protrusions jut out of its thighs. On its feet are large gray claws, three at the front and one positioned at the back, resembling high heels. Reshiram's tail is a mass of plume and ribbon-like extensions, surrounded by two large bands, similar to the ones around its neck. When its emotions surge, it enters Overdrive mode and its tail lights up with a fiery glow.

Reshiram has a jet engine-like tail, which it uses to accelerate itself when flying at high speeds. It can send flames from its tail into the air to incinerate everything around it. By flaring its tail, Reshiram is capable of moving the world's atmosphere and changing the weather. This tail generator is also activated when influenced by either Fusion Bolt or Bolt Strike, which in turn powers up Reshiram's own Fusion Flare or Blue Flare. In Unova mythology, Reshiram sided with the older brother who sought the truth. As a result, it firmly believes in truth.

Zekrom,644,Zekrom is a Dragon/Electric type Pokémon introduced in Generation 5. It is known as the Deep Black Pokémon.,"Zekrom is a black, bipedal Pokémon resembling a dragon or dinosaur, with dark patches on various portions of its body. It has red sclerae, white irises, and black pupils, as well as a small horn-like protrusion on the tip of its snout. Its head sports a thundercloud-like crest tipped with light-blue coloration. There are six pairs of pointed teeth visible when its mouth is open, two in the upper jaw and four in the lower. At the base of its neck is a black, stud-like feature, and atop its shoulders are similar, larger features resembling armor padding. The bases of its wings also have such padding, and a fanned, splayed, seemingly webbed shape with a small ""wing-spike"" on one edge. The lower length of Zekrom's arms extenuate into splayed, seemingly webbed, somewhat baseball-mitt-like formations, with three-clawed, dark-colored hands on the undersides. The front portion of Zekrom's waist is black-colored, with its belly and thighs having thin striations down their length. Its knees are black, as are the foremost parts of its three-clawed feet and spiked heels. When its emotions surge, it enters Overdrive mode and its tail lights up with a blue light.

Zekrom's tail consists of large, round, conical and spiked formation, likened to an electricity generator, with a black inner portion and bands on the tip of the outside portion. This tail produces energy for its attacks and emits an anti-gravity field, allowing Zekrom to fly through the air with minimal effects from aerodynamic resistance and gravity. It can cause several thunderstorms in one area, and it normally hides in thunderclouds. In a Unova myth about the twin heroes, Zekrom sided with the younger brother who sought for ideals. It is a genderless species. It is the only Pokémon that can learn Bolt Strike, though it is commonly associated with the move Fusion Bolt.

Kyurem,646,Kyurem is a Dragon/Ice type Pokémon introduced in Generation 5. It is known as the Boundary Pokémon.,"Kyurem is a gray and blue, bipedal Pokémon of indefinable but seemingly draconic basis. Kyurem has a blue head and snout and has yellow eyes without pupils, has a pair of pointed light bluish horns on its head and a yellow crest on its skull. Three pointed teeth jut out the bottom of either side of its jaws, which are frozen shut by the ice covering its head. Its long, gray neck has lines running around its whole body, legs, arms and tail. It has two arms, each with its own claw and each arm is jointed together from its oddly shaped blue wings, which are believed to be used for flying and storing cold air. Each wing has two spikes of ice. The ice covering the wings can break, revealing gray tendril-like appendages on Kyurem's back. The right side of its body seems to be damaged in some way, as the wing and horn on its head on that side are shorter; the right side of its head also has a spiked edge near its jaw hinge that is absent from its left. Its legs are somewhat slender, and has three sharp ice-like claws on each enormous foot. Its tail has three blue conical spikes on its tip, and appears to be some sort of propulsion device or a container of energy; exactly what it is based on is unclear, but it may be a damaged turbine.

Kyurem has two alternate forms, White Kyurem and Black Kyurem, which are formed by combining with Reshiram and Zekrom, respectively, and share many aspects of their designs with them. It can use Absofusion on their respective Dragon Stones to change to White or Black Kyurem. When transformed into either, its legs are just like before, but shorter and the middle toe becomes ice. As White Kyurem, it has some extra icy details on the legs. Its tail resembles that of Reshiram or Zekrom, but they are attached to the body with three gray parts of skin. The tail is capable of movement and contains four holes: they are horizontal on White Kyurem and vertical on Black Kyurem. The torsos of each form are similar, but White Kyurem's torso is more slim than Black Kyurem's bulky torso. Its shoulders are covered in 'squares' of ice with two pins protruding from each which can come out and 'plug in' the aforementioned holes. As White Kyurem, it has thin arms with two rings and three claws each, wings between the rings on its forearms, and its right arm and wing are frozen. As Black Kyurem, it has Zekrom's arms, but more muscular and without wings, and its left arm and wing are frozen. Its neck is the same shape, but becomes upright; White Kyurem uses Reshiram's fur and Black Kyurem uses Zekrom's skin. In both forms, the ice covering one of Kyurem's jaws (upper for White Kyurem, lower for Black Kyurem) has partially disappeared, allowing it to move its mouth. During battle, Black Kyurem and White Kyurem enter Overdrive mode and tubes sprout from its back to its tail. In White Kyurem's case, the ends of its hair and wings become fiery and its tail acquires fiery highlights. In Black Kyurem's case, parts of its right arm and the tip of the horn on the back of its head turn blue, while its tail lights up with electricity. In Kyurem VS. The Sword of Justice, Kyurem can also change into Black Kyurem or White Kyurem without fusing by channeling the power of powers of both Reshiram and Zekrom it has within itself.

Kyurem generates a powerful, freezing energy inside itself, but its body became frozen when the energy leaked out. Due to an old legend, it may be assumed Kyurem may be hostile towards Pokémon and humans, due to the fact it supposedly ate them if they were found outside at night. It is said to be an extraterrestrial Pokémon according to folklore.

Black Kyurem,646,Kyurem is a Dragon/Ice type Pokémon introduced in Generation 5. It is known as the Boundary Pokémon.,"Kyurem is a gray and blue, bipedal Pokémon of indefinable but seemingly draconic basis. Kyurem has a blue head and snout and has yellow eyes without pupils, has a pair of pointed light bluish horns on its head and a yellow crest on its skull. Three pointed teeth jut out the bottom of either side of its jaws, which are frozen shut by the ice covering its head. Its long, gray neck has lines running around its whole body, legs, arms and tail. It has two arms, each with its own claw and each arm is jointed together from its oddly shaped blue wings, which are believed to be used for flying and storing cold air. Each wing has two spikes of ice. The ice covering the wings can break, revealing gray tendril-like appendages on Kyurem's back. The right side of its body seems to be damaged in some way, as the wing and horn on its head on that side are shorter; the right side of its head also has a spiked edge near its jaw hinge that is absent from its left. Its legs are somewhat slender, and has three sharp ice-like claws on each enormous foot. Its tail has three blue conical spikes on its tip, and appears to be some sort of propulsion device or a container of energy; exactly what it is based on is unclear, but it may be a damaged turbine.

Kyurem has two alternate forms, White Kyurem and Black Kyurem, which are formed by combining with Reshiram and Zekrom, respectively, and share many aspects of their designs with them. It can use Absofusion on their respective Dragon Stones to change to White or Black Kyurem. When transformed into either, its legs are just like before, but shorter and the middle toe becomes ice. As White Kyurem, it has some extra icy details on the legs. Its tail resembles that of Reshiram or Zekrom, but they are attached to the body with three gray parts of skin. The tail is capable of movement and contains four holes: they are horizontal on White Kyurem and vertical on Black Kyurem. The torsos of each form are similar, but White Kyurem's torso is more slim than Black Kyurem's bulky torso. Its shoulders are covered in 'squares' of ice with two pins protruding from each which can come out and 'plug in' the aforementioned holes. As White Kyurem, it has thin arms with two rings and three claws each, wings between the rings on its forearms, and its right arm and wing are frozen. As Black Kyurem, it has Zekrom's arms, but more muscular and without wings, and its left arm and wing are frozen. Its neck is the same shape, but becomes upright; White Kyurem uses Reshiram's fur and Black Kyurem uses Zekrom's skin. In both forms, the ice covering one of Kyurem's jaws (upper for White Kyurem, lower for Black Kyurem) has partially disappeared, allowing it to move its mouth. During battle, Black Kyurem and White Kyurem enter Overdrive mode and tubes sprout from its back to its tail. In White Kyurem's case, the ends of its hair and wings become fiery and its tail acquires fiery highlights. In Black Kyurem's case, parts of its right arm and the tip of the horn on the back of its head turn blue, while its tail lights up with electricity. In Kyurem VS. The Sword of Justice, Kyurem can also change into Black Kyurem or White Kyurem without fusing by channeling the power of powers of both Reshiram and Zekrom it has within itself.

Kyurem generates a powerful, freezing energy inside itself, but its body became frozen when the energy leaked out. Due to an old legend, it may be assumed Kyurem may be hostile towards Pokémon and humans, due to the fact it supposedly ate them if they were found outside at night. It is said to be an extraterrestrial Pokémon according to folklore.

This frill can be raised to frame its head if needed. Its hands and feet are black with three digits each and there is an orange band with triangular markings around each leg. It has a long, tapering tail that is orange and then black at the tip.

Heliolisk can generate sufficient electricity to power a skyscraper, simply by flaring open its frill. This electric energy can be used to stimulates its muscles, which boosts the strength in its legs. This allows it to sprint a hundred yards in five seconds. Heliolisk and its pre-evolution, Helioptile are the only known Pokémon capable of learning Electrify.

Hawlucha makes up for its small body with its proficiency in fighting, which allows it to keep up with bigger fighters such as Machamp and Hariyama. It leaps around to stay in its opponent's blind spots and controls its position in the air by using its wings. A favored tactic is to strike from above, because it is a difficult maneuver to defend against. However, Hawlucha has a tendency to show off in the heat of battle; opponents can exploit its vanity to gain the upper hand. Flying Press is its signature move.

Goomy is considered the weakest Dragon-type Pokémon and is both the lightest and shortest Dragon-type. Its body is mostly water and is covered by a germ-laden mucous membrane. This slimy layer causes physical attacks to slime off harmlessly. However, it becomes unable to breathe and will die if its body dries out. Because of this, it stays in damp, shady areas. As seen in the anime, its diet consists of leaves.

Its gelatinous body forms a spiral shell-like structure on its back. Contained within the shell are its brain and other organs.

Sliggoo excretes and coats its body with a sticky mucous that can dissolve anything. Because it lacks teeth, it sprays this liquid onto prey and slurps them up once they are dissolved. Its eyes have devolved, causing it to go blind. This makes it difficult for it to tell allies from prey and it will sometimes attempt to melt its companions. Its four horns act as a radar system and are used to detect sounds and smells.

A pale green slime is usually visible dripping from its chin and arms.

Because of its meek, friendly nature, Goodra is often teased. However, it will strike at its tormentors with its retractable horns and powerful tail. It is also capable of throwing punches with incredible force. Its slimy coating in combination with a layer of fat causes attacks to slide off. When it grows close to someone, it will hug them and leave them coated in slime. If it is left alone, it will ooze gooey tears.

Hanging from the loop are various keys that this Pokémon has collected. Klefki is very tiny,  tying with Alolan Diglett and Meltan as the shortest Steel-type.

In the past, Klefki inhabited mines. When the minerals it fed on became scarce, it moved to human settlements. It now feeds on metal ions by inserting its key-like horn into chinks in metal. It likes to collect keys, particularly master keys, and will sneak into people's homes to steal them. While the exact reason for this collection is unknown, it does rattle its collection to threaten predators. It will never release a key it likes, so people will give it important keys as a way to prevent theft.

It has two arms with gnarled branches similar to its horns on the elbows. Around its wrists are cuffs of green leaves and it has three claw-like fingers on each hand. Instead of legs, it has six roots similar to a spider's legs.

Trevenant can control other trees by using its roots as a nervous system. It uses this ability to trap people who harm its forest and will curse people who cut down trees.

It is a small, green Pokémon with a gelatinous body. It has a large, round head with a beak-shaped protrusion on the front, a thin, hook-shaped tail, and a red hexagon suspended in its body. Within its head is a single eye with a black pupil; beside this eye is another white oval that may be a second eye. As seen in the anime, Zygarde Cores are capable of absorbing sunlight to regain their strength and can speak telepathically. Zygarde Cells make up every other part of Zygarde and appear nearly identical to the Zygarde Core. Unlike the Core, it has a flat body and head. It has a green pupil, a simpler, unhooked tail, and has a darker green, more elongated hexagon within its midsection.

Cores and Cells do not have the power to battle alone and can only fight when combined to form Zygarde. The Cores have their own will and are sometimes able to act on their own, while the Cells form the rest of Zygarde's body and are only able to act on the Core's orders.[1]

Zygarde 10% Forme has a relatively small canine body. It is primarily black with a green collar and a leash-like extension on its neck. Additional green markings include: two hexagon markings on its chest, a small hexagon over each eye, the area around its mouth, and its front left paw. There is an elongated, red hexagon marking attached to the collar marking. Its eyes are white hexagons with no discernible pupils and there is a thin, white line on its forehead. On each of its legs are hexagonal extensions: two on the back of each elbow, one behind each knee, and two on each hip. One of the hip extensions is longer than the other on each hip. This form has razor sharp teeth and is skilled at close range combat. It is also capable of running at speeds greater than 60 miles per hour (100 kilometers per hour).

Zygarde 50% Forme has a serpentine body with green and black markings. Most of its back, head, and neck are black, while the underbelly and the tip of its tail are green. Its eyes are made of four green hexagons, similar to an insect with compound eyes, and there is a thin, white line down the center of its face. Across the back of its neck is a large frill made of five long, flat protrusions that each have two small, green hexagons on them. There are three short tendrils on either side of its chest; they are black on the right and green on the left. Its tail also ends in five tendrils. It has many small, green hexagon markings on its body capable of glowing. This form of Zygarde is thought to monitor those who destroy the ecosystem from deep with its cave. Should the region's ecosystem fall into disarray, it will appear and reveal its power.

Zygarde Complete Forme has a large, humanoid body with a long tail similar to Zygarde 50% Forme's body. There are several flat protrusions around its head and triangular protrusions around its neck. These protrusions create a crown-shape. On its face are three white hexagonal marks: one in the middle of its forehead with a line through it and two that act as eyes. There are an additional five green hexagons on its face: four along the bottom and one in the middle of a short protrusion on top. Each shoulder has two serpentine wings protruding from it. The wings all have an undulating pattern and a hexagon near the tip: blue on the right side and red on the left. There are multiple white protrusions on its body: three on each hand acting as claws, one on each knee, and one and the front of each foot. Additionally, there are green hexagons surrounding its wrists and two under the white protrusions on its knees and feet. Its abdomen has a vertical, hexagonal pattern with thin, white line on either side. Across its chest is thin, zigzagging opening that fades between five colors: red, orange, white, cyan, and blue. The chest can open, revealing five cores of each color. Above this opening are two large green, hexagonal marks.

Possessing 100% of its total cells, Zygarde Complete Forme is said to exceed both Xerneas and Yveltal in power. The opening on its chest can radiate enough energy to destroy anything around it. This form only appears to neutralize threats to the ecosystems.

Diancie,719,Diancie is a Rock/Fairy type Pokémon introduced in Generation 6. It is known as the Jewel Pokémon.,"Diancie is a small Pokémon with a vaguely humanoid appearance. Its lower body is a conical, gray rock with a large, pink diamond in the side. Its upper body has two arms and is covered by a white material that resembles a dress. Its small, mitten-like hands poke out of the sleeves. Around its neck is a golden, half-circlet with a pink diamond in the center. Its head is gray with purple eyes that have red sclerae and pointed ears. On top of its head is a collection of pink crystals forming a headdress. There are four spike-like crystals along the top, a long crystal on either side hanging downward, and a large circular centerpiece on its forehead. There is a small, golden piece hanging off the center crystal and a small pink diamond embedded in the back of its head.

As Mega Diancie its white dress becomes longer and loses its sleeves. Its lower body turns into a pink crystal and is surrounded by a series of long crystals similar to those on its headdress. On the back, both the dress and the crystals are longer and additional, smaller crystals are suspended from the tips of the larger ones. The tips of the circlet around its neck curve outward and there is an additional half-circlet around its waist. The centerpiece of its headdress is now heart-shaped, and the remaining crystals are slightly smaller. The crystals hanging from the sides of its head have additional crystals suspended from the tips, and there is an additional hanging crystal on the back of its head. The diamond on the back of its head becomes rounded and two smaller gems form at the lower corners. Two ribbon-like structures grow from these additional gems; each ribbon has two small crystals suspended from the tips. Mega Diancie is known as the ""Royal Pink Princess"" due to its noble appearance.[1]

Diancie is born from a Carbink that undergoes a mutation. It can instantly create diamonds by compressing the carbon in the air. Diancie is the only known Pokémon that can learn Diamond Storm.

Its arms are not attached to its body and instead float next to it; each arm has a small golden spike similar to those on its shoulders. It has mitten-like hands and dark pink rings around each wrist. In place of legs, it has a wispy tail. Hoopa has three gold rings: one large one around its lower body and one hanging freely on each of its horns.

Hoopa Unbound is a large, bipedal Pokémon with six arms. It is mostly light blue with purple fur and hair. The ponytail on its head is larger and bushier and held in place by two golden rings. Its hair now covers its chin, where it forms a pointed beard, and the back of its neck. The horns are less curved and have spiky purple hair around the bases. There are three gold rings on each horn: two around the base and one around the middle. It has  yellow eyes white sclerae, a pointed, dark gray nose, a small hole inside of the ring-marking on its forehead, and prominent fangs in the back of its lower jaw. Similar to Hoopa Confined, its arms are disconnected and float next to its body. Instead  of a small, gold spike the arms now have large, dark gray spikes and appear from holes along the sides of its body. Each arm has three fingers with dark gray claws, a gold ring around the wrist, and a gold ring around the base. Several tufts of purple fur surround its torso and a gold ring encircles a hole in the center of its chest. Another large gold ring encircles its waist and there are small tufts of fur poking out from underneath it. There is a purple stripe that widens at the knee down each leg and two gold rings around each ankle. The tips of its feet are gold and curl upward. Additionally, this form has a tail with a purple stripe along the top and an arrow-shaped tip. Hoopa Unbound is tied with Mega Gyarados as the tallest Dark-type.

The rings on Hoopa's body can warp space and allow it transport items by passing them through its hoop. Hoopa Unbound is said to be Hoopa's true form and  is said to have the power to bend dimensions. This allows it to seize anything in the world. As seen in the anime, either form can travel through its rings and Hoopa Unbound has the ability to control and summon powerful Legendary Pokémon. Hoopa Confined is the only known Pokémon that can learn Hyperspace Hole, while Hoopa Unbound has its own signature move, Hyperspace Fury.

Volcanion,721,Volcanion is a Fire/Water type Pokémon introduced in Generation 6. It is known as the Steam Pokémon.,"Volcanion is a primarily maroon, quadruped Pokémon. It has pointed ears with blue interiors, bright blue eyes, yellow markings over and behind its eyes that resemble eyebrows and eyelashes, a pointed, yellow mandible, and a spike-like protrusion on each cheek. Its body is divided into three segments: a considerably larger front portion that has a hunched back, a thin, blue waist, and smaller hips that resemble its front portion. On its chest are four yellow, diamond-shaped bumps. There is a thin, yellow band around each of its leg joints and the lower, maroon portions of its legs are larger than the thin, blue upper portions. Each ankle has a short, blunt growth, while each foot has three yellow claws. Volcanion has a short, tapering tail with a slightly shorter blue bump along the top. On the back of the front portion of its body are two arm-like cannons. These cannons are normally held together and form a ring around the back. Each cannon is separated into three segments by bright blue lines and each segment has a single blue dot and a short, blunt growth. The topmost segments also have four small, yellow bumps around the ends.

The arms on Volcanion's back expel steam from inside its body. It can expel steam of superbly high pressure and has the ability to blow away mountains. As shown in the anime, Volcanion will eventually run out of water. When it does, a sound similar to a bell is heard, the lines and dots on its cannons turn red, and it is unable to use any Water-type moves until it refills its water supply from another source.

Rowlet,722,Rowlet is a Grass/Flying type Pokémon introduced in Generation 7. It is known as the Grass Quill Pokémon.,"Rowlet is a small, avian Pokémon resembling a young owl with a round body and short legs. Its plumage is primarily beige with a white underside and facial disc. The facial disc itself is in the shape of two overlapping circles. It has large black eyes and a stubby beak. The top part of its beak is white, while the lower half is an orange-brown. Its feet have two forward-facing toes and one backward facing toe; they are the same color as the lower half of its beak. Two leaves sprout from its chest, arranged to resemble a bowtie. Additional leaves form its tail and line the undersides of its wings.

A nocturnal Pokémon, it stores energy during the day through photosynthesis. It approaches opponents by silently gliding, before unleashing a volley of kicks. This Pokémon is able to rotate its head almost 180 degrees, and has excellent night vision.[1] Its feathers are as sharp as blades, which it launches at foes from the air. Rowlet feel most relaxed in tight, dark spaces.

Dartrix,723,Dartrix is a Grass/Flying type Pokémon introduced in Generation 7. It is known as the Blade Quill Pokémon.,"Dartrix is an avian Pokémon that resembles an owl. Most of its plumage is white, but it has dark brown feathers covering its head, shoulders, and back. Its heart-shaped, facial disc is also white, and it has large eyes with dark irises that usually appear closed, a stubby beak that has a white upper jaw and orange-brown lower jaw, and two short tufts of feathers on the back of its head. Two green leaves curve around its face, resembling an asymmetric cut; the leaf on its right is longer than the one on the left. Under its chin are two smaller leaves that resemble a bowtie, and there are two pointed ones on its rear that form its tail. Its wings have two tan spots on the upper side and leafy plumage close to the body on the underside. Within the leaves under its wings are two orange-brown objects known as blade quills. Dartrix has orange-brown talons with two toes facing forward and one facing backward.

This alert Pokémon is sensitive to the presence of others around it, and is capable of launching attacks on unseen enemies behind it. Razor-sharp blade quills are stored inside its wings, and it can propel them with astounding precision. By bending the feathers, it can even alter the trajectory of its strikes. Dartrix is narcissistic by nature, spending a great deal of time grooming its feathers to maintain its appearance. This compulsion will occasionally lead to it losing focus when its plumage is ruffled or dirty, even retiring from battle to preen. It has been described as a bit of a birdbrain as it has a tendency to bungle things up. Its desperate struggle to cover its mistakes sometimes makes the situation messier than ever. A Trainer who helps this Pokémon through this difficult stage will allow it to reach its full strength.[1]

Decidueye,724,Decidueye is a Grass/Ghost type Pokémon introduced in Generation 7. It is known as the Arrow Quill Pokémon.,"Decidueye is a tall, avian Pokémon that resembles an owl. The upper portion of its face is dark green with a thin, orange mask-like marking encircling its eyes. Its eyes are reddish-orange and it has a hooked dark green beak. The feathers covering its wings and back are brown, while the rest of its body is primarily white. The three feathers at the tip of each wing are structured similar to fingers and have lighter tips. The backs of its wings and torso are dotted with many white spots, there are six on each wing. The inside of each wing has a line of upside-down, reddish-orange triangles across the top. It has long legs, feet with two toes facing forward and two backward, and short dark green talons. Its tail consists of three long, green leaves.

A leafy hood covers its head and shoulders, and partially covers its face. The hood is smoothly draped across the shoulders and back, but has uneven edges. Around the head, the hood forms many pointed projections that extend over its face. A single white feather with a red base extends from the top of its hood. In the center of its chest is a reddish-orange X shape formed by dead leaves with two thin green vines extending from it. Pulling on the vines closes the hood further over Decidueye's face and improves its focus.

While this Pokémon is cool and cautious by nature, it begins to panic if surprised. It can hide from opponents by masking its presence, allowing it to attack unaware foes.[1] It takes only a tenth of a second for it to pluck, aim, and fire an arrow quill from its wings. It is not only quick, but also accurate, capable of striking targets over half a mile away. Decidueye is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Spirit Shackle and the corresponding Z-Move Sinister Arrow Raid.

There are two red stripes around each of its legs and two horizontal stripes with a vertical stripe across them on its forehead. The lower part of Litten's face is also red, and there is a large tuft of fur on each cheek. A tuft of fur sits at the end of its long tail. When it arches its back, three pointed tufts of fur with red tips appear along its spine.

Litten is a solitary Pokémon that does not typically display its emotions, and should not be given too much affection. While grooming, it collects fur inside its stomach. By setting the stored fur alight, it can spit fireballs that change based on how it coughs. Litten's fur produces flammable oils, and when it begins shedding, it burns all its fur in a blaze. Its fur coat regrows twice a year.

Torracat,726,Torracat is a Fire type Pokémon introduced in Generation 7. It is known as the Fire Cat Pokémon.,"Torracat is a quadruped, feline Pokémon with black and reddish-orange markings. Its upper half is mostly black, while its lower half is mostly red-orange. The black area has several red-orange stripes: one running up the center of its head forming a short cowlick with one horizontal stripe through the center and a slightly V-shaped stripe above its eyes, one running down its spine with two more stripes going across it, and two rings around its tail. The lower half of its body simply has two black rings around each leg. Its forelegs are more developed than its hind legs. Each paw has three toes, but the front ones are larger with short, black claws. Its tail has several tufts of fur on the tip.

Torracat has large eyes with black outlines, yellow sclerae, and black pupils that have a red tint along the bottom. There are two long tufts of fur on each of its cheeks with a shorter tuft just underneath on either side of its chin. Its mane stands on end when it is in a good mood, and lies flat when it is not feeling well. It has a tiny, triangular gray nose and long, pointed ears with gray insides. Hanging from its neck is a round, bell-like organ, which is yellow with an orange center. When Torracat attacks, this organ sometimes flares with wing-like projections to the sides.

The bell-like organ is actually a flame sac. Based on this Pokémon's emotions, the temperature of the bell will rise and eventually it will spit flames. The release of fire creates the sound of a bell. The mane around this Pokémon's face acts as a sensory organ, allowing it to navigate in darkness and sense hidden foes. Despite sometimes acting spoiled with those that it trusts, Torracat has a fierce battle spirit. It loves to fight, and its relentless onslaught causes others to lose the will to fight. Its punches are capable of bending iron bars with a single strike.[1]

Incineroar,727,Incineroar is a Fire/Dark type Pokémon introduced in Generation 7. It is known as the Heel Pokémon.,"Incineroar is a bipedal, feline Pokémon with a muscular build. It has a short snout with a small red nose, bright green eyes with yellow sclerae, and tiny, pointed ears. Large tufts of red fur extend from its cheeks, and much of its face is also red. The upper half of its muzzle and the top and back of its head are black. A thin red stripe runs vertically along its head to its snout, where it splits into a V-shape over its eyes. Its torso is gray with several black stripes and seems to resemble a wrestler tank-top; the front and back both have a single vertical stripe up the center, crossed by two horizontal lines. Around Incineroar's waist is a belt formed from flames that somewhat resembles a championship wrestling belt. In the front center is a small, yellow flame shape. The arms, legs, and tail are all red with black stripes forming bands around them. The arms have three stripes, spiky tufts of black fur over the shoulders, and large five-fingered hands with white claws and a single light red pad on the palm. Its legs have only two stripes and simple three-toed paws, and the tail has one stripe and a tuft of spiky black fur around the tip.

Incineroar's flame belt is produced from within its body and burst from its navel and waist as its fighting spirit rises. In addition to spewing fire from its navel, it uses ferocious kicks and punches. This Pokémon disregards the safety of its opponents and on-lookers, sometimes striking the opposing Trainer with attacks. It is a violent Pokémon, and will sometimes ignore its Trainer's orders when it is not in the mood to listen. Despite this, it finds fighting unworthy opponents boring and gets motivated fighting a challenging one. Weak or injured opponents also cause it to lose the desire to fight, which others sometimes use to their advantage. It also values the attention of the crowd as Incineroar's spirit goes up while the crowd is excited or falters when the crowd is bored. While it tends to act like a heel, Incineroar is very happy internally when receiving the admiration of children or young Pokémon.[1]

Incineroar is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Darkest Lariat and the exclusive Z-Move Malicious Moonsault. For a brief time, Throat Chop was also its signature move.

Around its neck is a light blue ruff, which extends past its shoulders. It has four flippers. The front flippers are larger than the hind, and have white markings separating its toes.

Popplio is able to snort bubbles of water from its nose, which it uses as part of its battle strategy. On land, it uses the elasticity of its bubbles to perform acrobatic stunts and jumps. It practices daily with increasingly larger water bubbles. It can swim at 25 mph (40 km/h)[1]

Brionne,729,Brionne is a Water type Pokémon introduced in Generation 7. It is known as the Pop Star Pokémon.,"Brionne is a light blue, pinniped Pokémon with three ruffle-like growths around its body. The first ruffle is just under its front flippers, while the last is shortly before the tail. The ruffles alternate white and pale blue. Its long ears are made up of three segments that lighten and increase in size towards the tip; the first segment is ovoid, while the latter two are spherical. It has a long, conical snout with a white tip, a spherical pink nose, and large dark eyes with pinkish pupils. Its front flippers are much longer than its tail flippers, although both have white tips. There are three digits on the front flippers.

Brionne can create water balloons in a variety of colors. While it normally learns to dance from members of its colony, Brionne can also learn to dance from humans. It works diligently to memorize each dance through imitation, and gets excited when it sees a dance it does not know. It is capable of dancing in perfect time with others, even if it's never danced with them before. Large groups of Brionne can be seen dancing together on moonlit nights. Its battle strategy consists of dancing while creating water balloons. The dance confuses the opponent, and during this weakness, Brionne slaps the balloons toward the target where they explode. Only those who have earned its trust can see this Pokémon when it is sad. It will otherwise always act cheerful and never allow its sorrow to show.[1]

Primarina,730,Primarina is a Water/Fairy type Pokémon introduced in Generation 7. It is known as the Soloist Pokémon.,"Primarina is a marine Pokémon that resembles a cross between a sea lion and a mermaid. Most of its body is white, but it has a long, fish-like tail. It has a long snout with  a round, pink nose, bright blue eyes with long white eyelashes, and long light blue hair trailing off the back of its head. A tiara-like structure rests on its forehead, consisting of a line of pearls with a pink sea star at one corner and a thin, transparent blue fin extending back over its hair. Its hair is contained to a ponytail by two strings of pearls. This ponytail, as shown in the games and anime, becomes temporarily undone when it performs certain moves. On its body are three fins similar to the one on its crown: one that drapes around its shoulders and chest, one around its waist where the fishtail begins, and one near the tip of its tail. It has long front fins with three digits. Primarina's long fish-like tail is bright blue with small pointed, pink fins around its hips. Its tail fins are white, and it is capable of using them as feet to stand up.

Primarina uses water balloons and its voice as its main weapons. Because its voice is instrumental in its battle strategy, its care should be a priority for Trainers. The melody it uses has been passed down for generations. Water balloons are released as it dances, and are controlled by its voice. In the moonlight, the balloons glitter and create a beautiful scene. However, some of the balloons are explosive and triggered by touch. This theatrical Pokémon considers every battle a stage, and uses the non-explosive balloons as platforms to tease opponents.[1]

Primarina is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Sparkling Aria and the exclusive Z-Move Oceanic Operetta.

The undersides of its wings are white, and it has thin gray legs and feet. It has a flat tail.

Despite its slender appearance, Pikipek has powerful neck muscles and is able to strike 16 times per second with its beak. This allows it to not only drill through wood, but shatter stone as well. The holes it drills in trees are used for nesting, storing food, and collecting small, glittering objects. The noise of this Pokémon pecking can be used to communicate with others. This Pokémon feeds on Berries, and is able to attack opponents by zipping the leftover seeds at them. These shots have enough force to embed the seeds in trees.[1] Talonflame is a natural predator of Pikipek.

There is a white marking covering its chin and chest, and a half-circle, yellow marking on each cheek. Toucannon has dark blue eyes, light blue eyelids, and jagged, gray eyebrows. It has a long tail with a spiky ruff of red feathers around the base, and spindly blue legs. Each foot has two forward facing toes with black talons and two rear-facing toes with no visible claws. Its tail seems to be bent specifically for the purpose of holding it momentarily, as it can stand on it for short periods, possibly as a brace when firing seeds.

There are gases inside its beak, which can ignite and launch seeds with enough force to shatter boulders. Additionally, its temperature can exceed 212° Fahrenheit (100° Celsius) and cause severe burns on contact. It can use this beak to warm up eggs, as shown in the anime. This ability also allows it to use its signature move Beak Blast. In order to communicate, Toucannon strike each other with their beaks. The number and strength of the hits reflect how it is feeling. Toucannon is well known for forming loving couples. This makes it a common good luck charm at weddings.

Gumshoos,735,Gumshoos is a Normal type Pokémon introduced in Generation 7. It is known as the Stakeout Pokémon.,"Gumshoos is a long-bodied Pokémon similar to a mongoose. While it moves on all fours, it is capable of standing on its hind legs with its hands locked behind its back, similar to a human. Most of its coat is brown with a yellow underside that extends over the top of its tail. It has an additional yellow stripe that starts on its forehead and ends between its shoulders. There are tufts of fur near its shoulders, hips, and around the base of its tail. These tufts in combination with its yellow underside create the impression of an open trenchcoat. Its ears are rounded with a small notch, and are located on the sides of its head. It has a short snout with a pink nose, a large mouth full of pointed teeth, eyes nearly hidden under its yellow stripe, and tufts of yellow fur on its chin. There are three black claws on each of its four short legs. Despite its length, Gumshoos is thick bodied and has a wide, flat tail with longer fur on the tip.

Gumshoos hunts by patiently waiting along its prey's known travel routes and pouncing when the unsuspecting prey comes along. Due to its tenacious personality and ability to withstand intense hunger, it is able to wait for its prey for long periods without eating.[1]  Its favorite prey are Rattata and Raticate, but since Gumshoos is diurnal, it rarely encounters them. Once the sun sets, this Pokémon's stamina is depleted and it will fall asleep where it stands. It is not originally from Alola, and was brought over to take care of Rattata outbreaks.

When it clasps a Charjabug in its legs, it is able to utilize it as an extra battery. This allows it to continue firing powerful attacks. However, during fierce aerial fights, it will release Charjabug to make itself lighter and more mobile. It is an adept flier, capable of acrobatic maneuvers such as tailspins and sharp turns. Even as it weaves through complicated tangles of branches in the forest, it is able to maintain high-speed flight.[1] It is known to have a rivalry with Pinsir and Heracross.

A large portion of its yellow body is visible down the center of its chest and a tiny spot is visible in the center of its back. Crabrawler has three pairs of legs. The two rear pairs are smaller with yellow joints and blue tips. The foremost pair of legs has large blue pincers resembling boxing gloves. There is a small amount of meat in its claws, which is considered delicious.

A competitive Pokémon that hates to lose, this Pokémon uses its large claws as protection for its face and belly while it closes in on opponents. Crabrawler's pincers sometimes break off from overuse, but they grow back quickly. Crabrawler strives to achieve not only a high social standing, but a physically higher position as well. It can be found clinging to buildings or even tall people, and will punch anyone who attempts to remove it from its perch. In the event that it does lose, its mouth will foam before it faints.

While it is capable of splitting tree trunks, it usually punches trees to knock down ripe berries. Many Crabrawler will gather around a tree to compete for the ripe berries. [1] Crabrawler also preys on Exeggcute. It has been known to mistake Exeggutor for coconut trees, which shake and stomp Crabrawler off when climbed.

It has wide, flat white wings with a brown loop marking toward the bottom. In-between its wings is a white tuft of fuzz. It has four spindly legs with round feet.

Cutiefly is capable of detecting the aura of living things, such as plants, people, and Pokémon. It uses this ability to predict the movements of its opponents. It collects nectar and pollen from flowers, which are found by the color and brightness of their auras. However, when a living creature is excited, its aura resembles flower in full bloom. As a result, Cutiefly tends to gather around beings feeling strong emotions. This Pokémon can be found in fields and meadows, but is sometimes attracted to towns or buildings by the emotions of living beings.[1] Loving nectar and pollen, it often gets into skirmishes with Butterfree over food. Spinarak and Pineco are natural predators of Cutiefly.

Cutiefly is a very tiny Pokémon, tying with Joltik, Flabébé, Comfey and Cosmoem as the smallest Pokémon overall. Additionally, it is the lightest Bug-type Pokémon.

Ribombee,743,Ribombee is a Bug/Fairy type Pokémon introduced in Generation 7. It is known as the Bee Fly Pokémon.,"Ribombee is a tiny, insectoid Pokémon with a large head, slightly smaller body, and thin arms and legs. It is covered in fluffy, yellow hair with a white face, lower body, and a tuft of hair on its back. It has big eyes with a one white and one brown square speck in the center. Over its eyes are white hairs similar to eyelashes, and it has two black antennae. Around its neck is a brown scarf with a needle-like projection on the front. Two wings nearly as large as its body sprout from its back. The wings are white with three brown loop designs near the base. Its four thin limbs have bulbous hands or feet.

Ribombee uses its fluffy hair to hold pollen it collects from flowers. Rain turns its hair dirty and its pollen damp, so it only visits fields if the weather will remain clear. When storms are in the horizon, Ribombee hide in tree hollows and wait stock-still. The pollen and nectar its collects is used to form balls called ""Pollen Puffs"". These balls can be used as food or relieve tiredness with a soothing effect. The Alolan people sell Pollen Puffs as valuable nutritious supplements.[1] Pollen Puffs can also be used to attack with paralysis or dizziness, such as during Ribombee's signature move, also called Pollen Puff.

Midday Form,745,Lycanroc is a Rock type Pokémon introduced in Generation 7. It is known as the Wolf Pokémon.,"Lycanroc is a canine Pokémon resembling a wolf. It has three possible forms: Midday Form, Midnight Form and Dusk Form. The first two forms are influenced by Solgaleo and Lunala when bathed in solar or lunar energy.

In its Midday form, Lycanroc resembles a quadruped, light brown wolf. It has a white underbelly that extends up around its muzzle and eyes in a mask-like marking. It has pointed ears with dark brown tips and pink insides, big blue eyes, and a triangular, dark brown nose. There are four sharp fangs in its mouth: two in the upper jaw and two in the lower. Large tufts of brown fur extend from the sides of its head; three tufts on each side. A bushy, white mane covers its neck. Four dark brown rocks poke out of its mane, creating a shape similar to a stylized sun. The lower portions of this form's legs are white, and each foot has three dark brown claws. It also has a long, fluffy white tail. Its Dusk Form greatly resembles the Midday Form, except with orange-gold fur and green eyes, as well as a fluffier, rockier mane on its neck.

In its Midnight Form, Lycanroc instead resembles a slouched, bipedal wolf or werewolf. It has short red fur with white on its lower legs, and a white streak that covers its face, underbelly, and tail. It has pointed, button ears with black tips, three large tufts of fur on each side of its face, a triangular black nose, and a mouth full of sharp teeth. While the sclerae, irises, and pupils of its eye are visible, they all glow a pinkish red and no distinctive colors are visible. A mane of fur covers its back and shoulders, sweeping forward over its head to form a crescent moon shape. On either side of its body, just below the shoulders, two small rocks resembling claws poke out of the mane. A single, bigger stone projects out of the front of the mane over its head. Each of this form's paws has three black claws, and it has a stubby tail covered in long fur.

In order to avoid needless fighting, the Midday Form prefers to live alone and does not form a pack with others of its kind. However, it is a fiercely loyal partner to Trainers that accept it during its unruly stage. In battle, it darts past opponents while attacking them with the rocks in its mane. These swift movements leave many foes bewildered.[1] Broken fragments of its stone mane are considered good luck.

In contrast, Lycanroc's Midnight Form is thrilled by battling, and becomes more excited the stronger its opponent. This excitement is what causes its eyes to glow. [2] Its strategy consists of closing in on its opponent and encouraging attack, then countering with a powerful blow that knocks out its opponent. Trainers that can draw out its power earn its trust, but it despises those that it disagrees with or who try to force it to fight.

The Dusk Form Lycanroc shares traits from the previous two forms. Its stance, calm demeanor, and loyal nature are shared with the Midday Form. However, it also shares the Midnight Form's fighting spirit, including the red, glowing eyes at the moment of attack. Due to only evolving at sunset, the Dusk Form is considered the rarest of the three forms in Alola. [3]

Accelerock is the signature move of Lycanroc's Midday and Dusk Forms, but all three are able to use the exclusive Z-Move, Splintered Stormshards.

Solo Form,746,Wishiwashi is a Water type Pokémon introduced in Generation 7. It is known as the Small Fry Pokémon.,"Wishiwashi is a fish-like Pokémon. Even though an individual Wishiwashi is small and weak, the people of Alola still fear it and call it the ""demon of the sea"". This is because of Wishiwashi's powerful School Form, formed when a Wishiwashi is in danger and calls on its friends by shining its eyes seen as an SOS signal almost 25 miles (40 kilometers) away.[1][2] Wishawashi has numerous natural predators, including Dewgong, Wailmer, Wailord, Wingull, and Pelipper.

In its Solo Form, Wishiwashi resembles a small fish. It has large, light blue eyes with irises that resemble puddles of water and dark blue eyelids. The head and tail are both white. There is a line of white teardrop-shapes on each side of its body with the teardrop nearest the head being slightly larger. The top half of its body is dark blue and has a short, rounded dorsal fin. The lower half of its body is gray with two pectoral fins. This tiny Pokémon is both the shortest and lightest Water-type.

In its School Form, Wishiwashi resembles a large fish roughly formed from various smaller fish with glowing eyes. Starting with its head, its body is divided into four bands that each becomes a slightly darker shade of blue. A ring of bright blue glowing spots lines the front edge of the two middle bands. The centers of its ""eyes"" are formed by a single white fish with glowing eyes for pupils. Surrounding the white fish is a dark blue recess, and at the rear edge of the ""eye"" is a raised white area for eyelids. Above each eye is a single, dark blue fish shape. Wishiwashi's mouth gapes wide open, apparently unable to close fully due to gaps on each side. Its lips in the front are lined with glowing spots, and many more spots dot the inside of its mouth.

On each side of the School Form's body, in the second band, there is a pair of dark blue fish-shaped recesses. Wishiwashi is able to fire fish-shaped torpedoes from this area. Its pectoral fins are the same color as its head, and have three finger-like projections. There are glowing spots at the base of each ""finger"" and at the base of the fins themselves. On top of its head are two short projections shaped like fishtails, one behind the other. Additionally, Wishiwashi has a large dorsal fin that is darker around the base and has two glowing spots at the tip. The third section of its body has a ring of four spike-like fins around it.

Mareanie,747,Mareanie is a Poison/Water type Pokémon introduced in Generation 7. It is known as the Brutal Star Pokémon.,"Mareanie has a purple, stalk-like body and head. It has blue eyes with yellow pupils and sclerae, and three pointed teeth. The body consists of two sections; the top section is slightly smaller and overlaps the lower. On top of its head is a starfish-like collection of ten tentacles. All of the tentacles reach the ground, except for the one directly in front, which is shorter and leaves its face exposed. The tentacles are light blue and covered in purple spines. On top of its head is a purple area with a collection of spikes with a larger, yellow spine in the center. Mareanie is able to regenerate any body part overnight, except its head.

Bruxish feeds on Mareanie, which in turn eats the branches of Corsola. It uses the spike on top of its head to poison its prey and uses its tentacles to either trap its prey or deal the final blow. In the anime, it has also been seen attaching itself with all of its tentacles and releasing poison through its spines.

It is known as the Brutal Star Pokémon.,"Toxapex is a small Pokémon with large, starfish-like tentacles sprouting from the top of its head. It has bright blue eyes with yellow sclerae and pupils. Its main body is a dark purple and consists of two sections: its head and lower body. Its head turns dark blue on top where the tentacles connect, and its lower body has triangular protrusions extending in all directions. Additionally, its body is typically suspended due to the length of its tentacles.

The tentacles themselves are light blue on top and covered with spines and dark blue with pinkish-purple spines on the undersides. When the inner spikes are present, the outer spikes sink back into its tentacles, and vice versa. The tip of each tentacle has two yellow claws, and there is a ring of yellow spines around a pinkish-purple marking where all the tentacles meet on top.

Toxapex uses its 12 tentacles as legs to walk along the ocean floor, where it hunts for Corsola. They can also be used to create a dome-like shelter from the tides. Its spines can be fired at enemies and carry a powerful poison, which causes pain for 72 hours. Aftereffects of the venom remain even after recovery. If a foe bypasses its spines, it attacks with its claws instead.

Toxapex is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Baneful Bunker.

Mudbray,749,Mudbray is a Ground type Pokémon introduced in Generation 7. It is known as the Donkey Pokémon.,"Mudbray is a quadruped, equine Pokémon resembling a small donkey. It has a dark brown coat with a cream-colored underbelly, muzzle, and circular markings on each cheek. A short, teardrop-shaped blaze extends up from its muzzle, and it has long, pointed ears with pink insides. Its large eyes have horizontal pupils. Black bangs hang over its face before turning into a stiff mane along its neck. Additionally, it has a short, black tail. Thick, cream-colored mud surrounds each black hoof.

Mudbray can be kept happy by giving it time to frolic in and consume mud. Denying it this will cause it to become stressed and disobey its Trainer. This Pokémon boasts immense strength for its size and is able to drag or carry loads up to 50 times its own weight. The mud that collects around its hooves enhance its grip and power. Because it was hunted nearly to extinction when it lived all over the world, it is believed to run wild only in Alola.[1]

It is known as the Draft Horse Pokémon.,"Mudsdale is a large, equine Pokémon with short, brown fur and a black-and-red mane and tail. It has heavy-lidded, black eyes with a red rim along the bottom, a red blaze on its muzzle, and long, pointed black ears with brown insides. This Pokémon's mane extends down around its eyes. Along the top of its neck, its mane is black with red at the tip and stands up straight. On either side of its neck, the mane forms three thick structures similar to dreadlocks with red mud around the tips. The mane extends all the way down Mudsdale's back in a thin line before becoming its tail. The tail appears similar to its dreadlocks, but is much larger and has several black notches missing from the mud around the tip. Around its hooves is a protective coating of red mud, which has three notches around the bottom.

Mudsdale is known for both its powerful body and emotional fortitude, which prevents it from becoming agitated. Regardless of the trouble it is in, it will never cry out and defeats opponents with a single blow.[1] The mud around its legs gives its kicks extra force; one kick can turn a car into a scrap pile. When galloping, its hooves can dig holes in asphalt. While it is not swift, it has excellent stamina and can continue on for three days and three nights while dragging over 10 tons. It will mix dirt and saliva to create a special mud with resistance to both wind and water. Because of its unique qualities, the walls of some old house were coated with Mudsdale's mud.

Dewpider,751,Dewpider is a Water/Bug type Pokémon introduced in Generation 7. It is known as the Water Bubble Pokémon.,"Dewpider resembles a spider with a water bubble over its head. Its head and most of its abdomen are dark gray, while its thorax and six legs are light green. All of its legs are thin with a knobby joint in the middle, and three of its legs are typically used to anchor the bubble on its head. The green on its thorax extends onto its abdomen in three triangular markings. There are also several triangular flaps that extend upward and attach to the bubble over its head. The head itself has large light blue eyes with darker pupils and sclerae, two blue bumps on top, and light green mouth similar to a spinneret. There is an actual spinneret on the tip of its abdomen, which the anime has shown as capable of producing both silk and water bubbles.

Dewpider can only breathe oxygen dissolved in water, so the bubble over its head allows it to breathe on land. Additionally, the bubble provides protection to its soft head, and can be slammed into both prey and enemies. If two Dewpider meet, they compare bubbles and the one with the smaller bubble will move out of the way.

Fomantis,753,Fomantis is a Grass type Pokémon introduced in Generation 7. It is known as the Sickle Grass Pokémon.,"Fomantis is a small, plant-like Pokémon. It has large, dark pink eyes with slightly darker pupils. Bunches of light green leaves surround its head, and a particularly large tuft in front slightly overhangs its face. A small, dark green bulb sprouts from the center of its head, which emits a pleasant aroma. Around its neck is a collar of short, dark green leaves. Extending from its collar are four lighter green leaves with white tips: two in the front and two in the back. In the front, these leaves act as scythe-like arms. Its main body is pale pink with a thick, dark pink stripe down the front and back. It has a stubby tail and two short legs.

In order to achieve evolution, Fomantis stores up energy gathered by photosynthesis. It is nocturnal, so during the day it spreads its leaves wide to catch the sunlight. During the night, it spends its time searching for a new spot to sleep for the next day. It will not stay in the same spot for more than a day due to the danger involved. If anything bothers it while it is gathering sunlight, Fomantis will fiercely attack it. When regularly exposed to sunlight, it grows up with vivid coloration. Though it excels at long-range attacks, it will rarely use those that require it to use its stored photosynthetic energy.[1]

The top half of its head is light pink, while the bottom half is white. It has light red eyes and two green antennae with a small green lump between them. There are four extensions to the top half of its head: two on the top with red tips that resemble ears, and one on each side with white tips that resemble stylized hair. It has a light pink body with wavy, skirt-like extensions around the waist and a green abdomen and neck. Its thin, white arms end in large, red scythes with white along the bottom rim and a single green claw on the tip.

The coloring and shape of Lurantis's body and arms give it the appearance of wearing a long-sleeved dress, while its legs are similar to pants. Four red, wing-like appendages sprout from its back, each tipped with white.

Lurantis both looks and smells like a flower, a trait that it exploits to lure foes in for a surprise attack. Its brilliant coloration and elegant moves have earned it acclaim as the most glamorous Grass-type Pokémon. However, it does disguise itself as a Bug Pokémon for protection. Maintaining its appearance requires detailed grooming. If a Trainer does a good job caring for it, Lurantis will have an easier time trusting them than a lazy Trainer.[1]

Lurantis is capable of firing beams using its sickle-like arms. These beams can cleave metal plates and allow it to perform its signature move Solar Blade.

Morelull likes dark damp areas, but changes locations every night avoid depriving the plants in any one area of too many nutrients. In addition to locomotion, its roots are also used to communicate with other Morelull.[1] When in danger, it scatters spores that burst into bright, glittering sparks. The pulsing light of the spores can induce drowsiness. It is rumored that once, when a group of Morelull were disturbed and all threw out their spores at once, a plane passing overhead suffered a near brush with disaster.[2]

Morelull and its evolution are the only known Pokémon that can learn the move Strength Sap by leveling up.

At the base of its neck are two short, flat spines, which create the impression of a mask or bandanna tied around its head. Its eyes are light purple with slit pupils and there are several tooth-like protrusions along its upper jaw. Each foot has four pointed toes.

Salandit is found around volcanoes or arid environments. From the marking at the base of its tail, it can emit both a toxic gas and flames. The gas is created by burning body fluids and has a sweet odor that causes dizziness. However, Bug Pokémon are attracted to the scent and are common prey. The female can also release pheromones that attract males of all species, including humans.[1] Additionally, these pheromones may cause opponents to be controlled by this Pokémon's will. Because of this, male Salandit offers its food to females, leaving it malnourished and unable to evolve. While it is not a powerful Pokémon, it is able to unbalance opponents with its cunning techniques. It does have difficulty with Spinda, since that Pokémon is already off balance.

This Pokémon exudes a delicious smell from its entire body, which has made it popular with people of the Alola region. This scent has a calming effect on people, so they are often used as living air fresheners. However, its sweet scent has also caused it to be swallowed whole by other Pokémon, especially Toucannon. It is too sweet for human consumption, but its sweat can be used to make a juice.

While fleeing danger, Bounsweet skips along in a way that does not convey its desperation. As a result, no one ever comes to help it. It has been known to drive away enemies by rotating its calyx, but it becomes dizzy afterward.[1]

Its wide hips are made up of six segments and resemble the flesh of a mangosteen. Its slender arms have slightly rounded hands with no visible digits, and its legs have pointed tips.

While it has a delectable fragrance, this Pokémon also has a tomboyish personality that can make it hard to get along with. Its calyx has hardened, allowing it to play with other Pokémon without worrying about being damaged. However, the leaves spin as Steenee moves and often strike nearby objects. It apparently does not care what it hits, and even uses the calyx as a form of attack. Foes are struck with the leaves first, then kicked by one of Steenee's equally hard legs.[1]

Tsareena,763,Tsareena is a Grass type Pokémon introduced in Generation 7. It is known as the Fruit Pokémon.,"Tsareena is a bipedal, plant-like Pokémon with a humanoid appearance. Its torso, arms, and legs are dark purple, while its hips and head are white. It has heavy-lidded, dark purple eyes with purple eyelids and long purple eyelashes, but has no visible mouth or nose. The lower part of its face is hidden behind a short ruff extending up from its body. While its arms are slender with rounded, digit-less hands, its legs are long and powerful. The upper portions of its legs have three pointed projections just before the hips, creating the impression of long boots. The lower portions of its legs taper into small, pointed feet. It has wide hips made up of six segments that resemble the flesh of a mangosteen.

On top of Tsareena's head is a light green calyx. The shortest leaf of the calyx extends slightly forward and then curves to the right, similar to sideswept bangs. The other three leaves resemble long hair and extend nearly to the ground. The three long leaves each have three yellow spots near the top and three near the bottom; the markings are present on both the under and upper sides of the leaves. On top of the calyx is a growth resembling a small, purple crown with four thin yellow stripes.

This Pokémon has a high-class nature and punishes anyone that approaches it with evil in mind. This attitude will even be directed at its Trainer if given commands Tsareena dislikes, such as being told to use an ineffective move. Touching the crown-like growth on its head is said to render it defenseless, however.[1]

Tsareena fights using finely honed kicks and graceful movements, such as its signature move, Trop Kick. Every time it lands a hit, it cackles at its opponent. It will even continue kicking or stepping on a downed opponent, laughing boisterously. Additionally, its sweet fragrance acts a distraction. Because only the most powerful Steenee evolve into Tsareena, this Pokémon uses its power to protect its pre-evolved forms.

Comfey,764,Comfey is a Fairy type Pokémon introduced in Generation 7. It is known as the Posy Picker Pokémon.,"Comfey is a small, light green Pokémon with several flowers surrounding it. Its main body has an orange face with oval, light green eyes. On top of its head is a long, fluffy green crest that curls slightly over its face and extends backwards. A thin blue thread is attached to the back of its head, and has several flowers attached to it. The flowers are white, purple, red, and yellow. Comfey usually holds the last flower in its two short arms. On either side of the main crest is a smaller, pale yellow tuft. Comfey is one of the smallest Pokémon, tying with Joltik, Flabébé, Cutiefly and Cosmoem.

This Pokémon stretches sticky vines from its head to pick flowers to create the ring around itself, and will give these rings to those it likes.The flowers can also be thrown at enemy Pokémon to create an opening to either flee or attack. However, it feels uneasy without flowers. Comfey spreads oil from its body along its flower ring. The oil changes the flowers so they emit a soothing fragrance that affects both Comfey and its allies. This aroma can also help with the treatment of people and Pokémon at hospitals.[1]

Comfey is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Floral Healing.

While most of its body is covered in white fur, its hands, feet, and snout are bare with its light gray skin visible. The fur around its head and under its chin is longer and creates the impression of a long beard. It has a broad, flat nose and a black area around its eyes. Underneath each eye is a yellow ring marking, which is encircle by a light blue ring marking. In the center of its forehead is a yellow marking shaped like a four-pointed star. A cape of purple fur covers its back and is divided into many wavy clumps with strands of orange and light blue throughout. Oranguru holds a fan created from green leaves woven together with its own purple fur.

This solitary Pokémon spends its time deep in the forest, meditating high up in the trees. While it is not normally active, it will provide food to hungry Pokémon and give medicine to injured ones. It has even been known to use human tools or items, including Poké Balls. It has a lofty attitude and will give other Pokémon orders. This can make them difficult Pokémon for Trainers to handle. Ancient people actually thought Oranguru were people and called them the ""people of the forests.""[1] Oranguru does not get along with others of its kind, often battling out their wits for superiority. It will also occasionally venture to the beach to match wits with Slowking.

Passimian,766,Passimian is a Fighting type Pokémon introduced in Generation 7. It is known as the Teamwork Pokémon.,"Passimian is a black-and-white Pokémon resembling a powerfully built lemur with broad shoulders. Most of its fur is white, but it has a black muzzle, upper body, hands, feet and ankles, and tail. However, there is a wavy white ring near the tip of its tail. The fur around Passimian's head and face is longer and forms many small clumps, especially around the top of its head and under its chin. On top of its head is a pale green helmet similar to half of a coconut shell. The helmet has a small orange blaze on the front and two leaves that stand up straight attached to the back. Its eyes are partially hidden by its headwear, but its yellow sclerae and reddish-orange irises are visible. It is often seen carrying a large berry that resembles a green coconut. There are several leaves stuck on its body with saliva. The shoulders and chest all have one vertical and one horizontal leaf. While most Passimian have green leaves, the the anime has shown that there is a red leaf variant on Akala Island that has one additional horizontal leaf in each area. The leaves color and position are decided by the leader of a troop and aid in distinguishing one troop from another.

This Pokémon creates troops of 20 to 30 members. Each troop has a leader that picks 10 of the strongest members to search for food. This Pokémon's battle strategy involves throwing Berries at opponents, hard ones for damage and soft ones to obscure vision, and confusing opponents by throwing the Berry to other troop members. A troop's leader is the member that can throw these Berries the farthest. Through rigorous training, the troop improves its coordination, teamwork, and skill in handling Berries. Some Passimian are unable to handle the intensity and flee from the troop. In place of a troop leader, a captive Passimian looks to its Trainer for leadership. If its Trainer has poor form when throwing Poké Balls, it will refuse to obey.[1]

Wimpod,767,Wimpod is a Bug/Water type Pokémon introduced in Generation 7. It is known as the Turn Tail Pokémon.,"Wimpod is a small, arthropod Pokémon. Its main body is purple and is covered by silver plating across its back. There are four plates total. The first plate covers half of its head, but leaves room for its eyes. The upper lids for its eyes appear to be covered with additional plating. The three plates on its back overlap, and each has a single black triangle in the middle. It has a long spike on each side of its head that curves backward, large yellow eyes with two short extensions over them like eyelashes, and two flat antennae that extend over its back. There are four short legs on its underside, and it has a long, prickly tail.

This Pokémon is cowardly by nature and wary of both noise and sudden movements. However, its curiosity will cause it to approach people or Pokémon that are standing still. It will spit a poisonous liquid when threatened. The stench of this fluid warns others that danger is nearby. Wimpod will eat and store anything, including garbage from the sea. This habit makes them highly valued as cleaners.[1] When it finds coins, Murkrow and Meowth go after it.

It has a pale purple body covered with silver armor plating. It has relatively small head with bright purple antennae that converge with its mandibles to form a mask around its eyes. The eyes themselves are black and angular with light gray pupils. Behind its head and curving down its back are several armor plates, each with a long protrusion curving up from each side. There is a small, greenish triangle marking on the center of each plate. Most of its lower body is exposed, but there is additional armor resembling a loincloth around its waist and smooth pieces encasing its thighs and feet. Its feet each have a single black claw. Golisopod has three pairs of arms. The two foremost pairs are thinner, encased in silver exoskeleton, and each is tipped with a single, black claw. The hindmost pair of arms is longer and have much larger forearms. These large forearms both have three overlapping, armored plates on the back and two black claws. The plate closest to its claws is plain, while the last two each have two greenish, triangular markings.

Golisopod has a shell as tough as diamond and retractable claws that can cleave seawater in two. While it is skillful in battle, it often meditates peacefully deep in seaside caves. It is sometimes accompanied by Wimpod. Golisopod is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move First Impression naturally.

Sandygast,769,Sandygast is a Ghost/Ground type Pokémon introduced in Generation 7. It is known as the Sand Heap Pokémon.,"Sandygast is a Pokémon formed from sand. It is mostly a mound of whitish sand dotted with gray pebbles. A tunnel through its center acts as a mouth, and a small depression above that has two pebbles for eyes. A red shovel with a white handle is stuck blade first into the top of its head. On either side of its main body is a smaller mound reminiscent of a stubby arm.

Sandygast is born from grudges that seep into the sand, such as from Pokémon that suffer defeat in battle. It can suck the life force of people or Pokémon through its mouth. Apparently, in the Alola region, sticking a hand into Sandygast's mouth is a way of proving one's courage. A person who grabs Sandygast's shovel or puts a hand in its mouth falls under its control. It uses this power to make children add sand to its body so it can become bigger. A Sandygast that loses its shovel may replace it with something like a branch or a flag, but it is said to keep searching for its lost shovel.[1]

Sandygast and its evolution Palossand are the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Shore Up.

Palossand,770,Palossand is a Ghost/Ground type Pokémon introduced in Generation 7. It is known as the Sand Castle Pokémon.,"Palossand is a Pokémon resembling a yellowish sand castle with gray pebbles along the base. It has a square main castle for its body, two round towers for arms, and the top of another round tower with a conical point rising up from the body. A tunnel through the center of the main body creates a mouth. There is a line of five alternating blue and pink seashells over the top of its mouth. The central tower has six windows: three located in the front, one on each side, and one in the back. The two outermost windows in front of the central tower have tiny pebbles in them and appear to act as eyes. The two side towers have crenellations along the top with a ring of windows underneath. Palossand's main body has crenellations around the central tower. A ring of alternating pink and blue seashells surrounds the central tower just below the point. In the peak of its tower is a red shovel stuck handle-first into the top.

Each grain of Palossand's body has a will of its own. It controls adults to make them build it a sand castle, which provides it a disguise and defense. However, Palossand is able to replenish any sand it loses on its own. The shovel on its head rotates when Palossand searches for prey and is believed to function as a radar. It enjoys the life force of Pokémon and captures small Pokémon by creating a sandy vortex. The bones of its victims are kept beneath it and traces of its victims' ill will are left wherever Palossand passes. This is said to be the genesis of new Sandygast.[1]. As seen in the anime, Palossand can manipulate its size and can grow to the size of a building. Palossand and its pre-evolution are the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Shore Up.

Pyukumuku,771,Pyukumuku is a Water type Pokémon introduced in Generation 7. It is known as the Sea Cucumber Pokémon.,"Pyukumuku is a marine Pokémon with an ovoid, black body. Its face has two beady, pink eyes and a white mouth shaped roughly like a star or Daimonji. This Pokémon is capable of spitting its organs out through its mouth. The white organs can take different shapes, such as a fist. Two lines of three pink spikes run down each side of its back. The middle spike of each line is about twice as long as the others are. A fluffy white puff forms its tail.

Pyukumuku tends to find a spot it likes and stay there, even returning to the same spot if moved. Once all the food in its favorite spot has been consumed, it will continue to stay there to the point of starvation. Its body is coated with a viscous fluid that allows it to stay on land for a week without drying out. This fluid is also beneficial to people as a moisturizer. If stepped on, it will expel its fist-like organs and smack the perpetrator. It particularly hates having its mouth or spikes touched. Tourists dislike Pyukumuku due to its appearance and lifestyle and often accidentally step on Pyukumuku. This creates a need for part-time jobs on beaches chucking this Pokémon back into the sea. However, people in Alola have already taken to throwing the Pokémon back to the sea where it can find food when thin.[1]

Its head is enclosed in a brown helmet with green markings, designed to suppress its power to stable levels. The helmet has a large jaw piece that wraps around the front with large, round hinges on the side. Each hinge is covered by a green X-shaped marking. Small gray eyes can be seen from within rectangular black holes on the front, and there are two pointed ears on the top. Around the base is a collar with four protruding vanes that are tipped with a three-way spike. This collar has a thin green line between the vanes, and each vane has a green hexagon near the end. An axe-like blade with a band around the middle extends backward from the top of the helmet. The front tip of the blade has a small, silver spike that hooks downward.

A mane of gray fur hangs from below Type: Null's helmet and covers its shoulders and chest. Most of its torso and legs is covered in short black fur. The lower half of each front leg is insectoid and green with spikes along the back, while the rear legs have thick purple scales on the flanks, shins, and on the top of the foot. All four of its feet have three toes, but in the front two toes face forward and one backward. Additionally, the hind paws have a short, purple claw on the back of the ankle.

Silvally,773,Silvally is a Normal type Pokémon introduced in Generation 7. It is known as the Synthetic Pokémon.,"Silvally is a quadruped, chimeric Pokémon with traits from a variety of creatures. It has a mammalian head with mechanical parts. Covering most of its head and neck is a thick, silver mane that extends down over its chest. Its blunt snout is metallic on the bridge of its nose and upper jaw. It has a triangular black nose framed by three red lines, pointed ears with bright pink and black insides, one visible fang on each side of its lower jaw, and a slight overbite. Its eyes are bright silver, have no visible pupils, and appear to be surrounded by an empty, black space. On each side of its head is a circular, metallic drive, with a white circle crossed by a metal line. On top of its head is a large, axe-like fur or feather crest. The tip of the crest as a hooked, metallic piece, while the back has three white feathers.

Silvally's lower body is mostly covered in short, black fur. The lower half of each front leg is insectoid and green with spikes along the back, while the rear legs have thick purple scales on the flanks, shins, and on the top of the foot.

Its fish-like tail consists of two dark blue spines with a white fin stretched between them. The top spine has a line of short, gray spikes.

Once it finds a partner it trusts, Type: Null destroys its own control mask to become Silvally. It reverts to its natural, wild temperament, but it is nonetheless loyal to its Trainer, and will even risk its own life in its partner's defense. The destruction of its mask re-activates its RKS System, allowing it to change its type according to the memory attached to it; its eyes, spikes, drives, and fin membrane all change color to match its current type.

Meteor Form,774,Minior is a Rock/Flying type Pokémon introduced in Generation 7. It is known as the Meteor Pokémon.,"Minior is a spherical Pokémon with two forms: one form with a rocky outer coating and the other with its core exposed. When it sheds its rocky coating its core form is both the lightest Rock-type and Flying-type Pokémon. Both of its forms tie with Carbink and Dwebble as the shortest Rock-type.

In its shielded form, Minior resembles a modestly sized rock. Its rocky exterior is formed by four large plates separated by two large cracks. The cracks encircle its body both horizontally and vertically. Five white spikes extend just above the rocky surface, giving it a star-shape. Two large, black spots on its front resemble eyes, and there is a third spot in the center of its back. Rings of dark brown triangles surround the holes its spikes protrude from and the spot on its back, pointing outward. One of the triangles surrounding the spot on its back is replaced with a small, brown dot. The eyespots have a half-ring of triangles resembling eyelashes. One eye has a small, brown dot in the corner. Even while apparently at rest, Minior tends to spin slowly in place.

In its core form, Minior loses its rocky shell and its body is exposed. The core is a bright, pastel color. Depending on the color of debris and food it absorbed and ate while in the stratosphere, Minior's core can be Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, or Violet. A handful of darker triangles are also visible on its body in random places. Minior's eyes and mouth are formed from energy that floats in front of its body like a two-dimensional mask. The eyes are two large swirls and the mouth a smaller line. Its face tends to stay level regardless of how Minior spins the rest of its body.

Minior forms in the stratosphere from an aggregation of mutated nanoparticles, where it absorbs particulate matter from which it builds its core and shell. Eventually, this process makes it too heavy and it falls towards the surface of the planet. When its shell breaks from landing, Minior becomes lighter and capable of attacking quickly. However, it cannot survive for long with its core exposed, and will eventually die if not placed inside a Poké Ball quickly enough.

Core Form,774,Minior is a Rock/Flying type Pokémon introduced in Generation 7. It is known as the Meteor Pokémon.,"Minior is a spherical Pokémon with two forms: one form with a rocky outer coating and the other with its core exposed. When it sheds its rocky coating its core form is both the lightest Rock-type and Flying-type Pokémon. Both of its forms tie with Carbink and Dwebble as the shortest Rock-type.

In its shielded form, Minior resembles a modestly sized rock. Its rocky exterior is formed by four large plates separated by two large cracks. The cracks encircle its body both horizontally and vertically. Five white spikes extend just above the rocky surface, giving it a star-shape. Two large, black spots on its front resemble eyes, and there is a third spot in the center of its back. Rings of dark brown triangles surround the holes its spikes protrude from and the spot on its back, pointing outward. One of the triangles surrounding the spot on its back is replaced with a small, brown dot. The eyespots have a half-ring of triangles resembling eyelashes. One eye has a small, brown dot in the corner. Even while apparently at rest, Minior tends to spin slowly in place.

In its core form, Minior loses its rocky shell and its body is exposed. The core is a bright, pastel color. Depending on the color of debris and food it absorbed and ate while in the stratosphere, Minior's core can be Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, or Violet. A handful of darker triangles are also visible on its body in random places. Minior's eyes and mouth are formed from energy that floats in front of its body like a two-dimensional mask. The eyes are two large swirls and the mouth a smaller line. Its face tends to stay level regardless of how Minior spins the rest of its body.

Minior forms in the stratosphere from an aggregation of mutated nanoparticles, where it absorbs particulate matter from which it builds its core and shell. Eventually, this process makes it too heavy and it falls towards the surface of the planet. When its shell breaks from landing, Minior becomes lighter and capable of attacking quickly. However, it cannot survive for long with its core exposed, and will eventually die if not placed inside a Poké Ball quickly enough. The cute, pastel coloring of Minior's core form often inspires designers to use it as a motif for clothing and accessories.[1] While in the ozone layer, it serves as food to stronger Pokémon. Places where Minior fall are few, Alola being one of them.

Komala,775,Komala is a Normal type Pokémon introduced in Generation 7. It is known as the Drowsing Pokémon.,"Komala is a gray Pokémon similar to a koala. It has large, rounded ears with light orange fur on the inside. Its large, ovoid black nose extends up between its fluffy white eyebrows, and there are additional white puffs of fur on each cheek. There is a small ruff of longer, gray fur around its neck. Each hand is black with five short fingers, and it has three black claws and a black paw pad on each foot. Its underbelly is white, as is its short fluffy tail. Komala is usually seen holding a short wooden log, which it is given at birth. The log is typically a light brown with darker, oval markings all over it. The ends of the log are tan with the growth rings visible.

This Pokémon stays asleep from birth to death, staying this way because of its diet containing leaves with sedative properties. While its expression sometimes changes as if it is aware of its surroundings, this appears to be a result of its dreams instead. It is able to eat, travel, and even battle without waking. If the log pillow it clings to is removed, it will be unable to sleep well and thrash wildly. However, it will sometimes cling to the arm of a Trainer it trusts. During a deep sleep, it stops moving altogether. According to ancient people, if a small amount of the saliva created when it eats leaves is watered down and ingested, one will be able to sleep well.[1] Hypno has been known to hunt this Pokémon.

Turtonator,776,Turtonator is a Fire/Dragon type Pokémon introduced in Generation 7. It is known as the Blast Turtle Pokémon.,"Turtonator is a bipedal, turtle-like Pokémon with a spiny shell. Its skin is a muted green and only visible on its limbs, tail, head, and neck. On top of its head is an additional shell with many points around the brim. This extra shell has a black center, yellow in the middle, and a red outer rim. Its eyes have black markings around the bottom, and it has a tubular, yellow snout with a single, large nostril. Turtonator has a wide mouth with the lower lip marked by a jagged yellow line extending from its nose. On each side of Turtonator's long neck are two short, triangular projections. Its front legs have mitten-like hands, while its hind feet have claw-like red growths around them. Most of its tail is also covered by red plating, which has fin-like projections. The shell that encases its body has a red underside with a star-shaped, yellow-rimmed hole in the center. The back of the shell has a yellow center with several spikes: four large spikes with red bases form a star-shape in the center with four smaller spikes around them.

This Pokémon resides on volcanoes, where it camouflages itself among the rocks and waits for prey. In addition to hunting, Turtonator also feed on sulfur and other volcanic materials. This diet rich in explosive material has contributed to a layer of explosive material in its shell. When prey steps onto its shell, it strikes itself with its own tail to cause an explosion. The explosion is ignited by sparks from the spikes on its shell and released through the hole on its chest.[1] This orifice also acts as Turtonator's weak point. Its explosive capabilities are dampened by the rain, however, so it takes refuge in caves on rainy days. It is also capable of spewing poisonous gas and flames from its nostrils.

Turtonator is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Shell Trap.

Togedemaru,777,Togedemaru is an Electric/Steel type Pokémon introduced in Generation 7. It is known as the Roly-Poly Pokémon.,"Togedemaru is a spherical, rodent-like Pokémon. Most of its front is white, while its back is primarily gray. It has black eyes, a short pointed snout with a black nose, rounded ears, and a circular, yellow marking on each cheek. Scattered across its back are 14 fur spikes that appear as yellow and brown triangular markings. When attacking, surprised, or agitated these spikes will stand straight up. There is a tail-like needle on the back of its head. The needle is gray with a yellow tip and is shaped like a lightning bolt. Additionally, it has stubby arms and legs.

Togedemaru uses the needle on top of its head to attract and gather electricity. Groups can be seen gathered with their needles standing upright, waiting to be struck by lightning on stormy days to make up for its somewhat limited electric capacity. Some Trainers use its ability to absorb electricity as strategy in battle. The opponent is coaxed into unleashing an Electric-type attack, and then has that power turned against it.[1] When it is pleased, this Pokémon will curl into a ball and roll around uncontrollably.

Mimikyu,778,Mimikyu is a Ghost/Fairy type Pokémon introduced in Generation 7. It is known as the Disguise Pokémon.,"Mimikyu is a small Pokémon whose body is almost entirely hidden under a rag. Its small size makes it the shortest Ghost-type. Its beady black eyes are visible through holes in the body of its disguise, and the fringe of an amorphous foot or lower body is visible under the hem. Occasionally, it will also extend a black appendage from under its rag. The veil itself resembles a Pikachu. The cloth is yellow with black tipped ears. The Pikachu face appears to be drawn with crayons, consisting of black eyes, red cheeks, and a squiggly black mouth. Mimikyu also carries a small stick resembling a lightning bolt to create a tail for its costume. When its disguise is damaged, the costume's head droops limply backwards, revealing Mimikyu's ruse. Larger rips in the costume are accompanied by shadowy vapors pouring out from whatever is hidden within.

A lonely Pokémon, Mimikyu is always covered by its disguise. Since this Pokémon is weakened by sunlight, it is rumored that the veil is used for protection. It is believed that seeing its true form will cause a mysterious illness or even a painful death. Mimikyu's disguise is modeled after Pikachu because of the popularity of Pikachu-styled merchandise, thinking that its disguise would allow it to make friends with people.[1] If its rag is damaged or its neck is broken, it will spend all night patching it. It then seeks revenge on the one that damaged it, fearing that its true identity could have been exposed. Mimikyu finds repairing its neck difficult, often causing it to cry. Mimikyu is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the Z-Move Let's Snuggle Forever.

Bruxish,779,Bruxish is a Water/Psychic type Pokémon introduced in Generation 7. It is known as the Gnash Teeth Pokémon.,"Bruxish is a fish-like Pokémon covered in colorful scales and fins. The front of its body is light blue with large, dark purple lips and a mouth full of sharp teeth. The upper half of its body is mostly light purple, while the lower half is mostly yellow. The purple portion of its body is dotted with light blue spots. The yellow underside extends up around its eyes, which are light purple with light blue pupils. Its eyelids are dark purple with long, light blue eyelashes. Its fins are all dark purple, light blue, or a combination of the two colors: the pectoral fins are mostly dark purple with a short line blue line along the bottom, the dorsal fin is light blue, the ventral fin is dark purple, and the tail fin is dark purple with a light blue, heart-shaped marking in the middle. On top of its head is an protuberance with a dark purple bulb at the tip. The bulb is able to open like a flower, which reveals a light blue orb in the center.

This Pokémon buries itself on the seafloor, leaving only the growth on its head exposed. By emitting a low level of psychic power, it serves as radar to detect prey. Additionally, the protuberance can emit a strong psychic power. Opponents bathed in this power are stricken with terrible headaches and fall unconscious. Prey, which includes Shellder and Mareanie are ground into mush and eaten.

When emitting psychic power, Bruxish grinds its teeth. This sound is enough to send nearby Pokémon fleeing immediately. In the Alola region, lifeguards allow this Pokémon to remain in their area to prevent other, dangerous Water Pokémon from gathering.[1]

Bruxish is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Psychic Fangs by leveling up.

Drampa,780,Drampa is a Normal/Dragon type Pokémon introduced in Generation 7. It is known as the Placid Pokémon.,"Drampa is a serpentine Pokémon similar to a Chinese dragon. Most of its skin is blue-green, but the lower half of its face and the underside of its neck are a pale green. There are three spots on each of its sides that are also light green. It has pink eyes with rounded, yellow eyebrows, a short mustache, and a small, white beard with a circular extension. On top of its head is a mop of white hair split into four rounded sections: two draped down either side of its head. Fluffy white fur drapes the lower half of its body and conceals its arms when they are tucked against its chest. When its arms are spread, two short claws are revealed on each hand. It has a bushy white tail with a small, curved spike at the base.

This dragon Pokémon lives alone in the mountains 10,000 feet above sea level. The Berries it feeds on do not grow at this altitude, so it descends to the base of the mountains daily at dawn. It loves communicating with people and Pokémon, and is especially gentle with children. It will often appear in areas where children gather and plays with them. Despite its gentle nature, it becomes enraged if a child it cares for is hurt, and can go as far as to burn the bully's house down if able. [1] As seen in the anime, Drampa is capable of flying.

Dhelmise,781,Dhelmise is a Ghost/Grass type Pokémon introduced in Generation 7. It is known as the Sea Creeper Pokémon.,"Dhelmise is a Pokémon made up of an anchor and ship's wheel, held together by a mass of green seaweed. The anchor is a rusty brown mottled with blackish spots. The seaweed, which is Dhelmise's true body, partially envelops the thick, curved bottom of the anchor in a zigzag fashion, leaving empty spaces that look like sharp teeth. The seaweed continues upward to cover the anchor's thin shank and the spindle of the wheel. Five individual strands of seaweed trail off this small hub is a star-shape.

The ship's wheel is lavender on the outside with a yellow inner rim. It is affixed to the back of the spindle by its center and able to rotate freely. The noticeably damaged wheel features six spokes and four handles, all of which are yellow. There are two lavender stubs where the other handles should be. A simple compass, resembling an eye, is set into a yellow ring-shaped component on one side of the wheel; mirroring this is an identical ring on the opposite side, though nothing is set into it.

Dhelmise preys on large prey, such as Wailmer and Wailord. The heavy anchor can be swung with enough force to knock out its prey in a single blow. The prey is then enveloped in seaweed, which can be stretched hundreds of yards, and its life-force drained. In addition to hunting, this Pokémon maintains itself by adding new detritus and seaweed to its body. It is known to get along well with Skrelp and Dragalge.

Jangmo-o,782,Jangmo-o is a Dragon type Pokémon introduced in Generation 7. It is known as the Scaly Pokémon.,"Jangmo-o is a small, quadruped Pokémon similar to a dinosaur. The lower half of its body is black, while the upper half is light gray. It has a beak-like snout with a small, tooth-like spike in each corner of its lower jaw and big, red eyes. On the front of its head is a large, heart-shaped yellow scale. A small tuft similar to ears or small feathers extends from the back of its head on either side, and there is another small, white tuft on its chest. Six teardrop-shaped, loose-hanging scales form a half ring around its shoulders. These scales are gray with pale yellow along the outside edge. A solid yellow scale of the same shape is on the tip of its tail. Each of its feet has three yellow claws.

While Jangmo-o trains diligently and remains humble, it has the pride of a warrior. It employs the scale on its forehead for both attack and defense, so it never shows its back to its foe. Many Trainers take this behavior as proof of this Pokémon's valiant nature. Jangmo-o lives and trains with others of its kind in harsh areas that are far away from other Pokémon and people.[1] The scales on its body make a metallic sound when struck and are used to express emotion, communicate with others of its kind, and intimidate opponents.

Hakamo-o,783,Hakamo-o is a Dragon/Fighting type Pokémon introduced in Generation 7. It is known as the Scaly Pokémon.,"Hakamo-o is a bipedal, reptilian Pokémon with many scaly plates. Most of its body is light gray, but it has dark gray arms and legs. It has angular, red eyes, a rounded, beak-like snout with a small spike on either side of the upper jaw similar to teeth, and two small scales standing up on either side of its head. Down the center of its chest is a line of three slightly raised scales, and there is a matching line of four scales down its back. Several slightly raised gray scales overlap its shoulders. In between its shoulders and on each side of its head is a small, white crest made of feathers. It has three yellow claws on each appendage and a long, tapering tail.

This Pokémon has many scale plates on its body as well. There is a yellow one on its forehead, which is oval with a light yellow, heart-shaped stripe across the middle. Two circular scales cover the front of its neck; both are light yellow with darker edges. The tops of its arms are covered by three overlapping scales. The first two arm scales are gray with yellow trim, but the last scale is red with yellow trim and much larger. At the tip of its tail is a small, circular scale. This last scale has a light yellow portion before ending in a darker yellow.

This Pokémon leaves its fellows to begin training on its own and can be found wherever there are opponents for it to fight. When it finds an opponent, it dances and clangs its scales together to show its strength. This ferocious dance climaxes with a challenging war cry. Because its scales serve as armor, it overwhelms its opponent with attacks without worrying about its own defense. This battle style causes many of its scales are torn off or broken. Hakamo-o considers its broken armor and bare arms as proof of a well-fought battle and wears them with pride.[1] However, the scale begin growing back immediately and harder and sharper than before. Its scale conduct heat well, so shed ones are often molded into pots and pans.

Kommo-o,784,Kommo-o is a Dragon/Fighting type Pokémon introduced in Generation 7. It is known as the Scaly Pokémon.,"Kommo-o is a bipedal, reptilian Pokémon covered in scaly armor. Most of its body is gray with some lighter gray areas as well as yellow and red markings. It has a rounded, beak-ish snout and small eyes nearly hidden under its head armor. On the tip of its snout is a patch of pale gray and both the upper and lower jaws have a small, tooth-like spike on each side. The top of its head is covered by an elaborate arrangement of scales. At the front of the headdress is an oval scale, which is yellow with a red heart-shape at the base. On either side of the front scale is a chain of four circular scales; the first three scales are red with yellow trim and the last scale is solid yellow. Three additional chains of plain yellow scales extend from the back of the headdress. Running down the front of its long neck is a line of overlapping scales: one solid gray at the top, three larger gray ones with yellow rims, and one solid yellow scale at the bottom. A thick yellow stripe with a rounded projection in the center runs across its chest. Covering its shoulders are tufts of spiky, white feathers with small, gray scales overlapping them. Four overlapping scales cover the tops of its arms: three are gray with yellow edges and the scales that cover its hands are red with yellow edges.

Kommo-o has four scaly chains, all of which consist of four scales, extending from just behind its shoulders. The two foremost chains are made of overlapping scales and have a solid gray scale at the top followed by three scales with yellow edges. The other two chains consist of only solid gray scales and do not appear to overlap. The lower halves of its legs are dark gray and there is a pale gray marking across each knee. Its hands have four yellow claws, while the feet have only three. A long line of slightly raised, pale gray scales runs down the center of its back to about halfway up its tapering tail. Near the tip of its tail are three sets of loose scales that increase in size near the tip. Each set is made up of four separate scales that encircle the tail; the two lower sets are solid yellow, while the set nearest the tip have gray centers. The very tip of its tail is pale gray.

Kommo-o, having completed its harsh training, returns to its birthplace to protect Jangmo-o. However, it only watches over them from a distance. The power of this Pokémon's uppercut is enough to send foes flying, so simply raising its arms can generate enough force to change its surroundings. According to legend, Kommo-o's glittering scales are meant to drive away a great darkness. The reason it seeks strong opponents is also said to be a quest for power to defeat the darkness.[1] Its scales function as both offensive weapons and defensive shields. Because it does not wish to fight weak foes, it clangs its scales together when it senses someone approaching. Weak or cowardly opponents will panic at this sound and flee immediately.

Tapu Koko,785,Tapu Koko is an Electric/Fairy type Pokémon introduced in Generation 7. It is known as the Land Spirit Pokémon.,"Tapu Koko's head and torso are black with white markings on its chest, just above its eyes, and on top of its head. Extending from the top of its head is a large, orange plume with bristles along the back. There is a yellow marking covering the top bristle and half of the bristle below it. The bottom of this crest goes all the way to its neck, where it divides its face in half and creates a beak-like nose. It has small, blue eyes with yellow markings behind them. The lower half of its body is orange with four pointed projections: one short spine on the front and two short spines in the back, with one longer spine between them. These spines resemble a bird's tail feathers. Its thin arms have round, yellow structures encircling its shoulders. On each arm is a shell that appears to be half of a bird mask, and its hands end in two large claws to create a beak for the mask.

The mask itself is mostly yellow with black, orange, and white markings. There are three white triangular markings with black edges on the top of each half of the mask, which create diamond-shapes when the mask is closed. The 'eyes' consist of a white diamond connected to a slightly larger orange diamond, which is inside a larger yellow diamond. Each of these shapes is edged in black. On each half of its beak is an orange triangle with a white rim. There are wing-shaped structures on each side, toward the back. Tapu Koko is able to pull the mask together and hide its upper body inside, creating the impression of a stylized rooster.

This Pokémon is called the guardian deity of Melemele Island. It's known for protecting its home, but it is fickle and will not necessarily help people in need. However, it is very curious, and may come to play or battle with people or Pokémon that interest it. It is able to store electricity by closing itself inside the shells on its arms.[1] It has an explosive temper, but it instantly forgets what enraged it in the first place.

Tapu Koko and the other guardian deities share the signature move Nature's Madness and the exclusive Z-Move Guardian of Alola.

Tapu Lele,786,Tapu Lele is a Psychic/Fairy type Pokémon introduced in Generation 7. It is known as the Land Spirit Pokémon.,"Tapu Lele has a black upper body and head with a few small white markings. Its eyes are blue with a pink line through the middle of each iris. Below each eye is a curved white line and above each is a curved pink line separated into three segments. On its upper body is another, thicker curved white line. Its thin arms have digit-less hands and puffy pink bracelets on each wrist. On top of its head is a mass of dark pink, tentacle-like hair. Two longer strands of hair frame its face. Encasing its dark pink lower body and on top of its head is a shell resembling an insect.

Tapu Lele's shell is primarily light pink. The portion on top of its head is conical with a white diamond marking in the center and a white half-diamond marking below that. Both diamond shapes are framed with black. The shell around its lower body mirrors these diamond markings and has an additional half-diamond on the back. On each side is a hexagon marking consisting of five dark pink triangle and one light pink triangle all outlined in black. These resemble the compound eyes of many insects. There are also projections on the back of the shell that resemble butterfly wings and a small black bump on the bottom similar to a curled proboscis. When closed, the shell resembles a bug's head with small wings.

This guardian of Akala Island is known to scatter glowing scales, which affect others by stimulating and healing their bodies; however, these scales are also dangerous if too many are touched at once. Some consider it to be cruel for the way it destroys others as it scatters its scales for its own amusement. An old legend says that Tapu Lele ended a war between Alola's islands by healing the tired warriors with its scales, but rumors point to a more disturbing truth behind this story. Its strength comes from the energy stored within its shell. If Tapu Lele finds itself at a disadvantage in battle, it will prioritize not outright losing as opposed to trying for a decisive victory.[1] It is said to gain energy from the scent of flowers.

Tapu Bulu,787,Tapu Bulu is a Grass/Fairy type Pokémon introduced in Generation 7. It is known as the Land Spirit Pokémon.,"Tapu Bulu has a bulky, black body with thick arms and no legs. It has blue eyes with an orange line across each iris. Under each eye is a red line divided into three segments with a smaller, white line below that. There is a short white line above each eye. In the middle of its face a what appears to be a golden nose similar to a bull's snout. There a white ring through the nostrils of the nose. On each side of its face is a thick white line that curves upward at the outer tip. There are red rings around its shoulders and golden, cloven hooves at the end of its arms. Its tail is mostly covered in a golden bell with two thin black rings around the top and a wavy black line around the bottom. A tuft of fur is just visible inside the bell. On top of its head is a pair curved, black horns. Each horn has a thick yellow marking near the tip and half of a wooden shell attached to it.

Tapu Bulu's shell is primarily red with white and yellow markings thickly bordered by a muted black. The shell itself resembles a flower or plant when open; when closed, the horns shift to the sides and it takes on the appearance of a bull. The top of each half is slightly thicker than the bottom, which gives the ""bull"" a slightly protruding brow. At the bottom of each half is a white rectangle with a muted black triangle at the bottom. Above the rectangles are two triangular markings; the top triangle slightly overlaps a larger, yellow triangle. Behind and just touching the yellow triangle is a tiny, white rectangle that creates the ""bull's"" eyes. The side has a single, tiny yellow triangle marking.

This guardian of Ula'ula Island is able to command vegetation to grow and change shape to its will. Despite its fearsome power, it is largely inactive, leading some to consider it a lazy Pokémon. It has a peaceful disposition and does not like to cause unnecessary violence, so it rings the bell on its tail to alert others of its presence. However, it is merciless to those who offend it and it is said to have once repelled thieves from its ruins by swinging trees like clubs.[1] The ruined Tapu Village stands as another example of the guardian's wrath.

Tapu Fini,788,Tapu Fini is a Water/Fairy type Pokémon introduced in Generation 7. It is known as the Land Spirit Pokémon.,"Tapu Fini has a black body shaped similarly to a mermaid or fish. It has light blue eyes, white eyelids, and a light blue, fin-like marking around the outer corner of each eye. It has a white T-shaped marking on its forehead and a small, white V-shape on its chest. Around its shoulders are segmented purple rings and its long thin arms have webbed hands with three fingers. Each finger is tipped with a purple claw. On the front of its lower body is a light blue, fin-like projection with three spikes. It also has light blue fins on top of its head that resemble long, flowing hair.

Tapu Fini's main body resides inside a violet shell that resembles a swordfish head when closed. The top half of the shell has a fin with light blue webbing on top and a thin, pointed spine on the front. On each side of the top shell are two C-shaped markings facing each other to form a rough circle. One marking is white and one is light blue, but both are outlined in black. These markings form the ""eye"" of the swordfish. Along the edges of both shell halves are a series of white triangles with black outlines.

As the guardian of Poni Island, Tapu Fini can freely manipulate water and gains energy from ocean currents. To avoid harm to itself in battle, it shrouds its surroundings in a mysterious fog that sends its opponents into a self-destructive trance. The guardian also unleashes this fog as a test for those who seek the special water it can create, which is said to purify anything it touches. Many humans have attempted this trial, including those with ill intent; disgusted by this history, Tapu Fini does not care much for humans. Despite this, it is willing to help those who prove themselves worthy.[1] As shown in the anime, Tapu Fini has shown to be able to make water clocks out of water and bridge the world of the living with the world of the dead using mist. Long periods of exposure to this mist can trap people within it forever, specifically targeting those who cannot endure the pain of seeing a deceased loved one again.

Cosmog,789,Cosmog is a Psychic type Pokémon introduced in Generation 7. It is known as the Nebula Pokémon.,"Cosmog is a small Pokémon with a gaseous body similar to a nebula. The gases that make up its body range in color from violet to light blue. The very center of its body is black both in from and back. The black space on the front contains its face, which consists of beady yellow eyes, circular blue cheeks, and a small mouth. The space on the back has only a single blue dot. There is a golden half-circlet on both the top and bottom half of its body, which divides it exactly in half. Two wispy extensions containing starry specks serve as its arms. Its gaseous body makes it very light as it ties with Gastly, Haunter, Flabébé, and Kartana as the lightest Pokémon.

Its body is frail and easily blown away. However, Cosmog is carefree and doesn't seem to mind. It collects dust from the atmosphere, which allows it grow slowly. Cosmog has the ability to warp itself and those close to it, as well as open Ultra Wormholes, but only when under stress. This process is very dangerous for Cosmog, and the use of its powers can leave it immobile for extended periods of time. Cosmog is theorized by the Aether Foundation to be a type of Ultra Beast, and its name was coined by one of the professors at the Foundation. In ages past, it was known as the “child of the stars”. In behavior, Cosmog has an overly trusting nature and it immediately takes a liking to whoever shows it kindness, even when that person doesn't have the best intentions for it.[1]  This Pokémon can be created by Solgaleo and Lunala.

The main portion of the shell is a flat oval around the center of the orb. Eight more flat, half-oval projections surround the orb in an asterisk-shape. At the center of the main body is a much smaller black core. The upper half of the core has a thin blue line on the front, back, and each side, while the lower has pink lines. On the front are two orange semicircles, which appear to be closed eyes. The overall shape of this Pokémon also resembles an eye.

Encased in its sturdy, cocoon-like shell, Cosmoem is unable to move. In Pokémon Refresh, it cannot even eat. It grows as it absorbs light, and its body is warm to the touch. In ancient times, it was worshipped as the ""cocoon of the stars"" by the people of Alola.

Cosmoem is one of the smallest Pokémon tying with Joltik, Flabébé, Cutiefly, and Comfey. Despite this, it is also the heaviest Pokémon, being tied with Celesteela.

Solgaleo,791,Solgaleo is a Psychic/Steel type Pokémon introduced in Generation 7. It is known as the Sunne Pokémon.,"Solgaleo is a large, white Pokémon resembling a lion. It has a blunt muzzle with a blue-gray nose and pale blue eyes. The top half of its face is a deep blue area that shows a constantly changing starscape. Four yellow spikes frame Solgaleo's head like a crown and two more pairs of spikes adorn either side of its lower jaw. Each spike separates large tufts of Solgaleo's mane. Solid ridges—red nearest Solgaleo's head and yellow farther away—poke out of each tuft along the middle, except on the tufts on its cheeks and chin, with the topmost part wrapping around the tip of the tuft. Overall, its mane creates the impression of a stylized sun. Around each leg is a dark orange band, and there is a black spot on each foot. It has three black toes on each foot with long yellow claws. At the tip of its tail is a large black spot with a thin yellow rim.

When Solgaleo enters its Radiant Sun phase, its third eye appears on its forehead—a light blue symbol similar to a compass rose—and the starscape turns to streaks of light. The fur on its body glows a pale yellow and all other parts of its body except its nose turn bright yellow.

Known as the ""beast that devours the sun,"" Solgaleo has long been honored as an emissary of the sun.[1] It said to live in another world and returns there when its third eye activates. Its body is capable of holding a vast amount of energy and glows when active. The intense light it radiates can make nighttime look like midday. Solgaleo can create Ultra Wormholes to travel to and from Ultra Space. Along with its counterpart Lunala, it can create Cosmog, which it is said to be the male evolution of. It can also influence a Rockruff's evolution into Lycanroc's Midday form with solar energy. [2]

It has a short snout, dark pink eyes with white centers, and a deep blue area on its upper head that shows a constantly changing starscape. A rigid, raised hood wraps around its head in a crescent shape and drapes around its neck as well. The outside of the hood is yellow, while the inner part that curves around Lunala's head is white with deep blue streaks. Its torso resembles a ribcage with a slightly curved spike on each shoulder and three spikes extending from the bottom toward its tail. Its massive wings resemble a bat's wings with the skeleton exposed, except that Lunala's wings have a total of seven ""finger bones"": four running through each wing, one running along the edge to the outermost tip, and two pointing upwards that may act as claws that are more functional. The four ""bones"" in Lunala's wings are only visible in segments. The skin of Lunala's wings is an iridescent deep blue and a light blue light source appears to glow from behind its ribcage. A large, pale yellow crescent connects the outermost tip of each wing to the next two inner tips, and the remaining two innermost tips are adorned by yellow, four-pointed stars. The bottom of Lunala's tail is also lined by a yellow crescent with a ridge running up the middle of the tail towards the ribcage.

When Lunala enters its Full Moon phase, its third eye—a light red symbol of an eye—appears on its forehead and the starscape turns to streaks of light. The skin of its wings glows a bright, light blue. It spreads its wings wide so that the yellow parts on each wing are arranged in a circle with the outermost points of the four-pointed stars disappearing in the transformation.

Known as the ""beast that calls the moon,"" Lunala has long been honored as an emissary of the moon. This Pokémon constantly absorbs light to convert into energy and can obscure daylight with darkness. When it spreads its wings to absorb light and glitters, it resembles a beautiful night sky.[1] It is said to live in another world, which it returns to when it opens its third eye. Lunala can create Ultra Wormholes to travel to and from Ultra Space. Lunala and its counterpart, Solgaleo, can create Cosmog, which it is said to be the female evolution of.

Nihilego,793,Nihilego is a Rock/Poison type Pokémon introduced in Generation 7. It is known as the Parasite Pokémon.,"Nihilego is an Ultra Beast that resembles a jellyfish. The bell is semi-translucent and encircled with several white, star-shaped markings. The wavy rim of the bell flares outward and is bright blue. Its tentacles appear gelatinous and give it a vaguely humanoid shape. Several tentacles mesh together forming the appearance of cape or long hair, while four shorter tentacles resemble shorter hair and arms. Two long tentacles make up the legs of the human-shape. In addition to its shape, it is sometimes seen acting like a young girl.

Nihilego is a parasitic organism and, by latching onto one's head, is capable of injecting a neurotoxin that subtly alters the thoughts and actions of any human or Pokémon that becomes its host. This neurotoxin stimulates intense feelings of excitement while causing a loss of inhibitions, which acts to forcibly bring out any latent potential within the host while wearing away at their minds. Nihilego's exact levels of intelligence are unknown, but according to Wicke, the Aether Foundation's research it seems to act mainly on a self-preservation instinct.[1] In its home dimension, the anime shows that Nihilego can control its environment.

Its size makes it both the heaviest and tallest Bug-type and Fighting-type Pokémon. Its head is small and flat with a black ridge up the center. It has two red compound eyes with two black, spherical basal joints for its red and black antennae between them. Protruding from under these joints is a long, silver proboscis. It has many bulging muscles that appear to be sacs full of red fluid with small white bubbles inside. There are three sacs on each arm, two on each leg, two on its chest, and several on its shoulders and down its back. Around its waist are three rings of smaller sacs. The muscles on its chest and some on its arms and waist have thin, grayish lines resembling tendons running across them. It has large, five-fingered hands with red knuckles and four pointed legs. There are several black spikes on its body: a small one on each side of its head, two on each shoulder, one on each elbow, and one on each leg. The portions of its body between its muscles are dark red or black. On its back are two pairs of pale orange wings with slightly darker veins.

According to Wicke from the Aether Foundation, its most notable feature is its ability to strengthen itself. By stabbing its proboscis into a foe, it absorbs the foe's energy. This in turn triggers a chemical reaction within its body fluids that causes its muscles to grow at explosive rates, further augmenting its already considerable strength. Buzzwole appears to strike bodybuilding poses before it performs any sort of action. This is thought to be its main form of communication, but what it could be trying to communicate is not understood.

It is known as the Lissome Pokémon.,"Pheromosa is an Ultra Beast that resembles an anthropomorphic, feminine cockroach. It is primarily white with a thin build. Its torso is composed of five thin discs that droop slightly downward. The widest disc makes up its shoulders, the second widest its hips, and the two smallest its chest and waist. There is a small gold ring at the base of its long, thin neck. Its arms and legs are also long and thin with gold joints. Its hands and feet are both composed of two golden claws. Pheromosa has a small, semi-flattened head a yellow, crown-like structure on top. The two tallest points of the crown point to its long, thin antennae, which are white with small gold balls at the tips. Attached to the back of its head are two structures resembling insect wings. The wings are transparent, curve slightly inward, and reach nearly to the ground. It has narrow, purple eyes with bright blue pupils.

According to Wicke from the Aether Foundation, Pheromosa's lithe, elegant body is capable of sudden feats of acceleration, able to twitch its limbs at an estimated 120 mph (200 km/h) instantaneously, a speed previously unseen in the world. It also produces a sort of disarming pheromone which was described as ""previously unknown to science"" that causes those nearby to become awestruck by its presence. It displays a considerable reluctance towards touching anything, as if it interprets the Pokémon world as being unclean somehow.

Xurkitree,796,Xurkitree is an Electric type Pokémon introduced in Generation 7. It is known as the Glowing Pokémon.,"Xurkitree is a very tall Ultra Beast that resembles a vaguely humanoid mass of electrical wiring. Its ""head"" a white, brightly glowing electric spark with numerous points and no visible face. Below its head is a mass of black cables for its torso and limbs; there are white bands resembling zip ties throughout its body as well. Its arms have ties where its shoulders, elbows, and wrists would be. The upper arms have two cables, while the lower have three. At the ends of its arms are copper structures that resemble hands, each with six flat ""fingers"". The legs have ties at the hips, knees, and ankles and are composed of four cables fused together for the whole length. The feet have four toes possessing ""claws"" of exposed copper; each foot has two fused toes pointing forward and two separate toes pointing backward. Finally, its tail has three ties and four cables, one of them loose in two sections. The tail ends in what resembles a three-pronged plug. It is the tallest Electric-type Pokémon.

Because this Ultra Beast reportedly raided a power plant, it is speculated to sustain itself with electricity. This is supported by observations that it will ""plug"" its limbs and tail into the ground when it is low on energy and enter a tree-like state to absorb electricity from the earth. Witnesses claim that its entire body crackles with astonishing electrical power. According to Wicke from the Aether Foundation, the cables that make up its body have been noted as being made of the same material as electrical wiring, and as such are highly efficient conductors of electricity. Its body contains an organ that produces energy, and it can discharge up to 1,000,000 volts at once.

Celesteela,797,Celesteela is a Steel/Flying type Pokémon introduced in Generation 7. It is known as the Launch Pokémon.,"Celesteela is a large, vaguely humanoid Ultra Beast with a bodily construction that resembles a cross between a space shuttle and a bamboo shoot. It has a small, white head with a tiny mouth and a skinny neck with three segments. On top of its head is a gray structure resembling a hat with long, flowing hair underneath. The hair reaches midway down its body and is rimmed with bright blue. The ""hat"" has two small blue dots and four white spikes arranged in a X-shape. These spikes resemble decorative hair sticks. On the very top of its hat is a long gray horn similar to a drill bit. It has large, disembodied gray arms that resemble bamboo stalks. At the end of each arm is a ring of bright blue, fin-like projections and a collection of smaller, black bamboo shoots. Each smaller stalk has bright blue ring with a small line extending back up the stalk.

Its main body is conical and resembles a dress with four overlapping layers. The shortest and outermost layer is the shortest and appears metallic, while the inner layers are each a lighter shade of green, progressively longer, and seem to be cloth or plant material. Underneath all the layers is a white body with a light gray crisscross pattern covering it and a bright blue ring along the base. Below the dress is what appears to be a collection of six black bamboo stalks. On the bottom of each stalk is a bright blue ring with a small line extending back up the stalk; this causes the stalks to also resemble rocket boosters. Celesteela is one of the heaviest Pokémon, tying with Cosmoem.

According to Wicke from the Aether Foundation, its most distinctive feature is the energy that it stores within itself: a flammable gas that it can shoot from its two huge arms. This is mostly used to propel itself in flight and for battle, but it is thought to have sufficient power and lift to even fly into space. Celesteela's rocket thrust is powerful enough to destroy an entire bamboo forest. Despite being Steel-type, Celesteela's body is plantlike and can absorb nutrients from the soil. As seen in the anime, Celesteela can have a long lifespan, as one was buried in Alola for over 200 years.

Kartana,798,Kartana is a Grass/Steel type Pokémon introduced in Generation 7. It is known as the Drawn Sword Pokémon.,"Kartana is a small Ultra Beast that resembles an origami human. It appears to be folded out of a sheet of paper which is white on one side and red on the other. Its head is folded slightly inside its body and has a four-sided star in the center, but no discernible facial features. On top of its head are two short antennae or horns that are wider at the top. It has long, thin arms that resemble katanas with a yellow, sheath-like structure around the upper area. The sheath connects to a red, slightly raised hexagon on its torso. Extending up and out from the base of each sheath are three yellow projections that are nearly as long as its arms. Its legs appear creased with areas of red visible along the edges. Its light, thin build makes it one of the lightest Pokémon, tying with Gastly, Haunter, Flabébé, and Cosmog.

Despite its small size compared to the other Ultra Beasts, Kartana is extremely dangerous, as every edge of its body is incredibly sharp. It is able to cut down a gigantic steel tower with one stroke of the blades on its arms, and any opponents that try to attack it will be similarly cut apart. According to Wicke of the Aether Foundation, its light, paper-like body allows it to evade most attacks by simply floating out of the way, but it also makes it highly vulnerable to fire and moisture. As seen in the anime, Kartana can open Ultra Wormholes. For a brief time, it was the only Pokémon that could learn Cut by leveling up.

Guzzlord,799,Guzzlord is a Dark/Dragon type Pokémon introduced in Generation 7. It is known as the Junkivore Pokémon.,"Guzzlord is a massive, black Ultra Beast, being the heaviest of all Dark and Dragon-type Pokémon. Its main body is primarily spherical with a large, yellow mouth in the center. The top and bottom of the mouth are lined with two rows of teeth; the front row is yellow, while the rear row is black. In the second row of the upper jaw, two teeth curve out of the mouth similar to tusks. The inside of its mouth is a bright blue and its throat is lined with small spikes; its large black tongue is also lined with small spikes. Additional tongues resembling long arms with pincers protrude from its lower jaw even when its mouth is closed. Just above its mouth are two glowing, blue eyes with a yellow, diamond-shaped marking between them. Above each eye is a single, bat-like wing with yellow along the upper edge. There are other small bat-like wings down the sides of its body as well. On the underside of its body are three, fin-like projections that curve up towards its mouth.

Guzzlord's body is supported by a pair of thick legs, which have yellow zigzag markings across the knees and three claws each. On top of its body is a small, conical head with a second, smaller pair of glowing blue eyes. Four short horns with yellow tips form a ring around its head. On either side of its head is a larger, slightly curved horn also tipped in yellow. There is also a pair of arms on top of its body. Each arm has a hand with three yellow claws. A row of small spikes trails down its back and along its tail. The tail itself extends from the center of its back and resembles a medieval mace.

Guzzlord is said to feel like hard rubber. In order to eat, its tongue moves in a wave-like motion that pulls food towards its mouth.[1] There have been reports of it eating mountains and buildings whole. According to Wicke of the Aether Foundation, its constant hunger causes it to eat anything within reach of its two, pincer-like tongues. Despite its appetite, no droppings have ever been found. It is speculated to convert everything it consumes into energy with no waste leftover.

Necrozma,800,Necrozma is a Psychic type Pokémon introduced in Generation 7. It is known as the Prism Pokémon.,"Necrozma is a vaguely humanoid Pokémon whose body appears to be constructed out of a black crystalline material. The large protrusion attached to its head is its tail, which has a row of three large spikes along the top and is white in the back with a dark gray symbol resembling a star in the center. Its face is actually a prism-like object known as the brain prism, which possesses a collection of multicolored shapes that resemble eyes. While absorbing light, this brain prism glows white.[1] Its thin arms have disproportionately large hands with three claws. Jutting out of the back of each hand is a whitish crystal that darkens toward the tip, and each elbow has a hook-like spike. Two large spikes jut from each shoulder and there is a row of smaller spikes along each side of its body. Its feet have three hook-like toes each.

Necrozma can take control of Solgaleo or Lunala by fusing with them, allowing it to assume its Dusk Mane Necrozma or Dawn Wings Necrozma forms, respectively. Because Necrozma is forcibly absorbing their light, Solgaleo and Lunala constantly glow in a manner similar to their Radiant Sun and Full Moon phases while fused. In both cases, the host's body is covered in parts of Necrozma's body, which is arranged like armor.

Dusk Mane Necrozma has armor around its paws, head, and sides. Necrozma's tail splits into two and attaches to the sides of Solgaleo's torso and its large claws extend from Solgaleo's back. The front feet have five black claws attached to it with two V-shaped crystals on top of it while the back foot has only three claws. It has a triangular helmet with a long, thin antenna on each side and Necrozma's brain prism prominently displayed. Solgaleo's own eyes and nose are visible as bright, blue lights. The host's tail gains a three black spikes attached to each other, as well as three spikes under the chin. A structure similar to one of Necrozma's legs extends from its back. Using the armor on its chest, it is able to propel itself by shooting black light.[2]

Dawn Wings Necrozma has armor around its torso, head, and certain parts of its wings and tail. It also has a triangular helmet with the brain prism visible, as well as Lunala's own eyes visible as glowing pink lights. Necrozma's arms extend from the center of its chest. The armor surrounding its body has two large spikes jutting up from around its shoulders and four, glowing pink lights in the center. On its lower back are two thin, antennae-like growths extending downward. A structure similar to Necrozma's tail extends from the center of its back, and like its Dusk Mane form, can be used as a form of propulsion. There are eleven crystalline spikes attached around the body, four each on the wings, and three on Lunala's tail. These spines are capable of firing dark energy.[3]

Once it absorbs enough light, Necrozma can undergo a process called Ultra Burst to reclaim its true form: Ultra Necrozma, a colossal dragon of pure light energy. Its size makes it the tallest Psychic-type. The various pieces of Necrozma's crystalline body are rearranged as a sort of ""skeleton"" for the rest of Ultra Necrozma's body. These pieces take on a golden glow from the light, but return to black without it. Its head is surrounded by several spikes and a pair of small wings, which causes it to resemble an eight-pointed star; there is also a small, lighter eight-pointed star on the back of its head. Its face is armored and has multicolored heterochromic eyes; the left eye is primarily red, while the right is mainly blue. It has two pairs of wings: one around its shoulders and one around its hips. While the wings themselves are made of light, the arm portions are made of its former legs and shoulders, respectively. Its former arms now cover its lower legs, and what was once its tail covers its chest. Finally, it has a long tail with a row of spikes along the top. Ultra Necrozma's body temperature exceeds 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit (5,540 degrees Celsius); anything that it touches will melt from the extreme heat. It can fire laser beams from every part of its body, and these lasers can reach over 18 miles away, burning through everything in their path.[4] As seen in the anime, when Necrozma uses up all its light it enters into a deep slumber unless it absorbs more light.

Necrozma originates from Ultra Space and is capable of opening and traveling through Ultra Wormholes. In Ultra Megalopolis, it is known as the ""Blinding One"" (Japanese: かがやきさま Radiant One). It once had the ability to give light, but lost this ability after being injured under unknown circumstances; Professor Kukui and Lillie theorize that the Sparkling Stones used to perform Z-Moves are fragments of Necrozma's body that it lost upon this injury. In its incomplete state, Necrozma suffers constant pain and displays immense hostility. In an effort to restore itself to its original state, Necrozma steals light from other places and beings. This behavior caused it to be feared as the ""pillager of light"" in ancient Alola. When Necrozma absorbs light from a world, that world becomes shrouded in darkness until the stolen light is returned.

Necrozma is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the moves Prismatic Laser and Photon Geyser, the latter of which can be upgraded into the exclusive Z-Move Light That Burns the Sky while in its Ultra Necrozma form. Dusk Mane Necrozma and Dawn Wings Necrozma can also learn Solgaleo and Lunala's signature moves Sunsteel Strike and Moongeist Beam, respectively, and upgrade them into their exclusive Z-Moves Searing Sunraze Smash and Menacing Moonraze Maelstrom.

It is known as the Prism Pokémon.,"Necrozma is a vaguely humanoid Pokémon whose body appears to be constructed out of a black crystalline material. The large protrusion attached to its head is its tail, which has a row of three large spikes along the top and is white in the back with a dark gray symbol resembling a star in the center. Its face is actually a prism-like object known as the brain prism, which possesses a collection of multicolored shapes that resemble eyes. While absorbing light, this brain prism glows white.[1] Its thin arms have disproportionately large hands with three claws. Jutting out of the back of each hand is a whitish crystal that darkens toward the tip, and each elbow has a hook-like spike. Two large spikes jut from each shoulder and there is a row of smaller spikes along each side of its body. Its feet have three hook-like toes each.

Necrozma can take control of Solgaleo or Lunala by fusing with them, allowing it to assume its Dusk Mane Necrozma or Dawn Wings Necrozma forms, respectively. Because Necrozma is forcibly absorbing their light, Solgaleo and Lunala constantly glow in a manner similar to their Radiant Sun and Full Moon phases while fused. In both cases, the host's body is covered in parts of Necrozma's body, which is arranged like armor.

Dusk Mane Necrozma has armor around its paws, head, and sides. Necrozma's tail splits into two and attaches to the sides of Solgaleo's torso and its large claws extend from Solgaleo's back. The front feet have five black claws attached to it with two V-shaped crystals on top of it while the back foot has only three claws. It has a triangular helmet with a long, thin antenna on each side and Necrozma's brain prism prominently displayed. Solgaleo's own eyes and nose are visible as bright, blue lights. The host's tail gains a three black spikes attached to each other, as well as three spikes under the chin. A structure similar to one of Necrozma's legs extends from its back. Using the armor on its chest, it is able to propel itself by shooting black light.[2]

Dawn Wings Necrozma has armor around its torso, head, and certain parts of its wings and tail. It also has a triangular helmet with the brain prism visible, as well as Lunala's own eyes visible as glowing pink lights. Necrozma's arms extend from the center of its chest. The armor surrounding its body has two large spikes jutting up from around its shoulders and four, glowing pink lights in the center. On its lower back are two thin, antennae-like growths extending downward. A structure similar to Necrozma's tail extends from the center of its back, and like its Dusk Mane form, can be used as a form of propulsion. There are eleven crystalline spikes attached around the body, four each on the wings, and three on Lunala's tail. These spines are capable of firing dark energy.[3]

Once it absorbs enough light, Necrozma can undergo a process called Ultra Burst to reclaim its true form: Ultra Necrozma, a colossal dragon of pure light energy. Its size makes it the tallest Psychic-type. The various pieces of Necrozma's crystalline body are rearranged as a sort of ""skeleton"" for the rest of Ultra Necrozma's body. These pieces take on a golden glow from the light, but return to black without it. Its head is surrounded by several spikes and a pair of small wings, which causes it to resemble an eight-pointed star; there is also a small, lighter eight-pointed star on the back of its head. Its face is armored and has multicolored heterochromic eyes; the left eye is primarily red, while the right is mainly blue. It has two pairs of wings: one around its shoulders and one around its hips. While the wings themselves are made of light, the arm portions are made of its former legs and shoulders, respectively. Its former arms now cover its lower legs, and what was once its tail covers its chest. Finally, it has a long tail with a row of spikes along the top. Ultra Necrozma's body temperature exceeds 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit (5,540 degrees Celsius); anything that it touches will melt from the extreme heat. It can fire laser beams from every part of its body, and these lasers can reach over 18 miles away, burning through everything in their path.[4] As seen in the anime, when Necrozma uses up all its light it enters into a deep slumber unless it absorbs more light.

Necrozma originates from Ultra Space and is capable of opening and traveling through Ultra Wormholes. In Ultra Megalopolis, it is known as the ""Blinding One"" (Japanese: かがやきさま Radiant One). It once had the ability to give light, but lost this ability after being injured under unknown circumstances; Professor Kukui and Lillie theorize that the Sparkling Stones used to perform Z-Moves are fragments of Necrozma's body that it lost upon this injury. In its incomplete state, Necrozma suffers constant pain and displays immense hostility. In an effort to restore itself to its original state, Necrozma steals light from other places and beings. This behavior caused it to be feared as the ""pillager of light"" in ancient Alola. When Necrozma absorbs light from a world, that world becomes shrouded in darkness until the stolen light is returned.

Necrozma is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the moves Prismatic Laser and Photon Geyser, the latter of which can be upgraded into the exclusive Z-Move Light That Burns the Sky while in its Ultra Necrozma form. Dusk Mane Necrozma and Dawn Wings Necrozma can also learn Solgaleo and Lunala's signature moves Sunsteel Strike and Moongeist Beam, respectively, and upgrade them into their exclusive Z-Moves Searing Sunraze Smash and Menacing Moonraze Maelstrom.

Magearna,801,Magearna is a Steel/Fairy type Pokémon introduced in Generation 7. It is known as the Artificial Pokémon.,"Magearna is a metallic, bipedal Pokémon that is made up primarily of spheres. Its head is a medium-sized sphere with a slight point in the back. Around its head is a gear with seven teeth, although the gear does not cover its chin. It has two large, rabbit-like ears with gold rims, a tiny nose and mouth, and light red eyes with pinkish ovals in the center. In the centers of the ovals are white crosses, and thin gold wiring encircles each eye with two small prongs similar to eyelashes. The rabbit-like ears appear to be two halves of a large disc held together by a hinge at the top.

Magearna's upper body is similar to a Poké Ball: it is divided into two light blue portions by a thick gray band. In the front center of the band is a circular depression that is half-blue and half-pink. Above and below the depression, in the light blue portions, is a yellow, diamond-shaped marking. On either side of its upper body is a large, spherical shoulder with thin upper arms that lead to large, claw-shaped forearms and slightly pointed hands. Its lower body is a much larger sphere that resembles a ball gown. There is a pair of golden, wavy lines on each side of this sphere, which is divided down the front and back by a gray line. In the back, there is a solid gold ring with a hole in the center at the bottom of this line. The front has a gold ring as well, but it is broken at the top and bottom and has a shield shape in the center. Metal plates similar to the ruffles of a dress adorn the bottom of its lower body. It has two pointed legs.

Magearna was created by a scientist 500 years ago. The sphere in this Pokémon's chest is known as the Soul-Heart, and the scientist created it by collecting life energy from Pokémon. The Soul-Heart is the true body of Magearna. Due to its ability to feel other's pain, it will try as hard as it can to save injured Pokémon. It can even perceive the emotions, thoughts, or feelings of other Pokémon as well. Whenever it is sleeping or sometimes when it is sad, Magearna can take on the appearance of a Poké Ball.[1]

Back when it was invented, Magearna's body was primarily painted gold, though a lighter shade than the highlights and rims that adorn its body. The ears and the top half of its lower body were painted red, matching the coloration of an ordinary Poké Ball. This vivid coloring is a sign that it was a present to royalty. The princess of the land was very pleased with it.

Magearna is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Fleur Cannon.

Marshadow,802,Marshadow is a Fighting/Ghost type Pokémon introduced in Generation 7. It is known as the Gloomdweller Pokémon.,"Marshadow is a humanoid Pokémon that appears to be made of smoky gray shadows. The area around its face resembles headgear, such as a helmet. On top of the helmet are two curled horns or ears with a wispy horn between them. Its eyes are orange-red with yellow pupils, and above each eye is a yellow, oval marking. Each arm has a small bump on the wrist. Around its neck is a smoky collar and there is a trail of shadows on each foot.

When angered or attacking, such as using its exclusive Z-Move, Marshadow's fighting spirit will begin to burn, causing it to become Zenith Marshadow. In this state, its headgear, wrist bumps, and collar flare up and resemble green and yellow flames. Marshadow's eyes also flare up when in this state, but do not change in color.

Very few people have seen it, so its existence was the stuff of legends and myths. A cautious Pokémon, Marshadow sinks into the shadows to ensure it is not noticed while it observes its surroundings. While in hiding in the shadows of others, it can understand their feelings and copies their abilities. Through mimicry, it will eventually become more powerful than those it imitates. As seen in the anime, Marshadow is also capable of causing nightmares. Marshadow is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Spectral Thief and exclusive Z-Move Soul-Stealing 7-Star Strike.

Poipole,803,Poipole is a Poison type Pokémon introduced in Generation 7. It is known as the Poison Pin Pokémon.,"Poipole is a small, purple Ultra Beast. It has a bipedal build with a large head and relatively small limbs with no visible digits. On its head are three spikes: one in the front and one on each side. A single gray needle protrudes from the top of its head and there are additional needles in the spikes on the sides of its head. It has oval eyes with a single eyelash-like spike above each; its mouth and eyes give off a cyan glow. It has a long, tapering tail with a single spine in the middle. While most of its body is dark purple, it has several fuchsia markings: at the tip of each head-spike, on its chest, on top of its head, and on its face.

Poipole originates from Ultra Megalopolis in Ultra Space, where it is popular as a starter Pokémon. It is capable of understanding human speech after spending enough time with humans. Its large head is filled with a glowing, adhesive poison, which it can fire from the needles on its head.[1] While spraying opponents with this venom, it laughs wildly. The anime reveals that wild Poipole live in nests that resemble wasp or hornet nests alongside Naganadel.

Naganadel,804,Naganadel is a Poison/Dragon type Pokémon introduced in Generation 7. It is known as the Poison Pin Pokémon.,"Naganadel is an Ultra Beast that has both draconic and insectoid features. It is a large creature, being the tallest Poison-type. Its upper body is slender with thin arms and a long neck. The upper chest, neck, head, and arms are light purple, while its waist is dark purple with a fuchsia stripe on each side. Each shoulder has a long gray spike and each hand has three pinkish purple claws. Running down each side of its neck is a dark purple stripe, which connect and form a loop on its chest. The lower area of the loop is fuchsia and has a short, downward extension in the middle. At the end of its long neck is its head, which has a long, spiked crest on the top. On the sides of its mouth are a pair of curved, gray spikes that act as mandibles. Its glowing cyan eyes are conjoined, rimmed with fuchsia, and have a spiky crest on either side, which gives them a visor-like appearance. A pair of light purple wings sprout from the center of its back. These wings have a single fuchsia claw at the joint, two spikes along the wing-arm, and darker purple membranes with fuchsia markings near the spikes.

The lower half of Naganadel's body houses its brain. It resembles a swollen wasp's abdomen and is filled with poisonous liquid. It is covered in stripes of light and dark purple and has three hollow stingers at the tip. The stingers are gray and have a fuchsia marking around them. The largest stinger is in the center; the other two are considerably smaller and sit on either side. These stingers are connected to its brain, so it will react violently if they are touched. Its main stinger can eject a luminescent, adhesive poison over a distance greater than six miles.[1] In the anime, Naganadel is shown to be able to communicate with humans through telepathy and show them visions of the past.

As seen in the anime, this Ultra Beast can freely move its head around easily and regenerate after blowing it up. It is known to trick its targets through the silly way it walks before blowing its head up without warning. It then steals their vitality to use as energy.[1] Blacephalon is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Mind Blown.

Zeraora,807,Zeraora is an Electric type Pokémon introduced in Generation 7. It is known as the Thunderclap Pokémon.,"Zeraora is a bipedal, feline Pokémon with primarily yellow and black fur. The fur is thinner and black on its lower legs, lower body, upper arms, and face, and is thicker and yellow everywhere else. There is also a zigzagging black stripe on each thigh and two more stripes on each forearm. There are small tufts of light blue fur on its chest and a longer tuft on its forehead. It also has a single, lightning bolt-shaped blue whisker on each cheek. A long, ponytail-like or tail-like bunch of fur extends from between its shoulders. Zeraora has large ears with black insides and blue eyes. Its forepaws have four clawed fingers and light blue pads, while its hindpaws have only three clawed toes.

Zeraora lacks an electricity-generating organ, so it gathers and stores electricity from outside sources. This Pokémon can create a very powerful magnetic field through the strong electric currents emitted from its paw pads. Using this magnetic field allows it to levitate and move at high speeds while airborne. It can travel as fast as a lightning strike. Its fur is known to stand on end whenever it is using massive amounts of electricity.[1] Zeraora is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Plasma Fists.

Meltan,808,Meltan is a Steel type Pokémon introduced in Generation 7. It is known as the Hex Nut Pokémon.,"Meltan is a small Pokémon with a silvery body of liquid metal. Its head resembles a golden hexagonal nut with small black sphere floating inside. This sphere serves as its eye. It has a red tail that resembles an electrical wire with two tiny protrusions at the end. Its body can corrode metal, which it then absorbs. Meltan can generate electricity using the metal it absorbs, and then fire it from its eye.[1]

According to Professor Willow, Meltan has been described in ancient texts found in the same place as the Mystery Box, a mysterious item that attracts Meltan to its location when opened. Professor Willow also states that Meltan is said to be created when it splits from Melmetal. As seen in the anime, the hexagonal nut on its body can be removed. It has also been seen working in packs. When provoked, it will spin its heads, creating a sound that calls others of its own kind. This head-spinning can also be used as a sign of affection. The anime has also shown Meltan can be tamed if fed metal-like treats. Meltan is one of the smallest Pokémon, tying with Alolan Diglett and Klefki as the shortest Steel-type.

A large, golden hexagonal nut encircles its neck and a smaller one acts as its head. Floating in its head is a small, dark gray sphere. It has a small red tail resembling an electrical wire.

Melmetal is a Pokémon that has come back to life after 3,000 years. In ancient times, it was worshiped for its ability to create metal from anything, which was used to create unique metal tools. According to Professor Willow, Melmetal was considered a sacred being that lived in a secluded area deep within a wooded land that was full of sedimentary rocks rich with magnetite. Melmetal can split itself into multiple Meltan. The process of evolution has hardened its body, making it incredibly sturdy. However, it is still in a liquid state and has some flexibility, particularly in its arms.[1] Melmetal is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Double Iron Bash.
